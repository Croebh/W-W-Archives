Maybe Arwyn ordered a pizza and forgot...again. The dragonborn opens the door and sees a tall darkly dressed man before her, eyes narrowing as she tries to recognize him...and does.* **&quot;Darius...right?&quot;** *He nods and looks her over, surprised to see her so grown up. Time flies.* **&quot;Arwyn...I haven&#x27;t seen you since you were-&quot;** *She raises her hand to stop him, this incredulous look on her face.* **&quot;If you say knee high, I&#x27;ll break your knees.&quot;** *He chuckles and nods. Arwyn is still just...surprised. This wasn&#x27;t unexpected; it was down right abnormal.* **&quot;If you&#x27;re looking for my dad, he isn&#x27;t here.&quot;** *, she says, eyes still furrowed.* **&quot;I see. Honestly I&#x27;ve been meaning to go visit him but...time has been running of late.&quot;** *Arwyn narrows her vision more and adopts an even more incredulous expression on top of what was already there.* **&quot;The last time I remember you visiting my dad was twelve years ago...how fast has time been running for you?&quot;** *He chuckles again. She doesn&#x27;t.* **&quot;Sorry...I was in the neighborhood on business and, well, I was hoping to ask about him.&quot;** *She looks him over and lets out a sigh.* **&quot;Listen, I know you and he used to run with the same party, but if you&#x27;re trying to drag him into anything than don&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t know what crap you lot used to get into but let him enjoy his retirement...or...whatever the hell it is.&quot;** *She says this with her normal laid back tone but with a tinge of aggression which just makes Darius smile.*

*~Wyndel...you made the right choice raising her. Maybe if I-* 

**&quot;You...alright?&quot;** *Arwyn asks curiously to which Darius just nods.* **&quot;Yes...sorry to bother you. Tell your dad I said hello. I&#x27;ll...try to visit him soon.&quot;** *With that Darius turns and walks away, leaving Arwyn confused but also...sad for some reason. She shakes her head though and shuts the door, thinking about pizza now...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-27</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn listens and just smiles, letting herself be pet and feeling...good.

She thinks this over and knows her girlfriend is right; she just had to...apply herself. Ugh, that was a weird feeling...the idea of WANTING to work hard on something. But then again improving herself had been coming back to the forefront of her mind, thanks to Nyx. She wanted to see Arwyn at least try, and that was something she had given up on...or at least she had. Now though, more than ever...* **&quot;I want to get stronger.

While I&#x27;m not sure why you two believe this, so what?

Soft, slow, gentle, soothing her as her unseen servant did the basic medical attention to her wounds, the supplies floating through the air, and to the uninitiated with magics, they may as well have been doing so. 

She gently cups her cheek and turns her face up to look at her own, their eyes locking. Then, her grip tightens just noticeably and a flicker of fire burns inside her pupils. **&quot;You do understand you will be explaining this, yes.&quot;** Once more, it wasn&#x27;t a question, but a soft command.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">Vian was about to snap at the magic user, clearly displeased as his mane rose and cracked with static, his jaw set hard. But the moment of care she showed for Arwyn gave him pause. Was it concern, or just a bitter taste for life that made her speak this way? Seeing the tiny sign of affection in the moment, the way, even unconscious, she sought her partner. He felt a pang of jealousy that he had never had that in life, just a moment before it died away.

[Draconic] ||**&quot;You fought like a tiger backed to a wall, ferocious. It was an honor, Arwyn. I look forward to perhaps painting together.&quot;**|| He bowed, turned to make his exit and offered, before he left, a parting statement. **&quot;She spoke briefly but respectfully about you, Arywn&#x27;s Partner. Disrespect to those who admire her is an insult to her. May you both have a peaceful day.&quot;** One last bow, and an exit.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn smiles and turns over, curling up in a ball and sleeping soundly.* **&quot;Sorry...babe...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">Nyx&#x27;s own thin wiry tail wraps around Arwyn&#x27;s for comfort after she notices the familiar motion.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">*The basic first aid was enough, Arwyn groaning in her sleep as she heard Nyx&#x27;s voice. her tail flicked a bit as if looking for something.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Typical of her.&quot;** She looks her over as she waves her hand to the side, a first aid kit seeming to float up from beside her desk and over to her. Her eyes scan over every inch of her body, making sure she was as alright as she could be, and that basic care would be enough. **&quot;Was your mother also absent from your life?&quot;** She comments rather coldly.

She uncrosses her legs and stands up, the heels on her boots clacking softly on the rug as she stands up. She runs a hand gently down her arm and continues to speak, now looking only at Arwyn. **&quot;Thank you for bringing her back, will that be all.&quot;** While phrased like a question, her tone made it very clear it was a sign for Vian to leave. She was visibly on edge and she didn&#x27;t bother hiding it.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">He entered, slowly, carrying Arwyn with considerable care. The strange dragonborn was set out on the couch respectfully, making sure none of her was hanging off, save the tail. Forget that giant danger noodle, just get it out of stepping-on range. **&quot;I am Vian Teng, Swordsman.&quot;** He turned to offer another bow, shallower this time. **&quot;I encountered Arwyn at the lake, intending to paint. After some exchange, we came to a conclusion, and an honorable test of skill.&quot;**  He glanced at the long tailed dragonborn again, havign long forgotten the split lip and bloody nose she gave him, then back to the sharp eyes Nyx. **&quot;I suspect her mother is not only from my lands... but that her mother may be related to mine own.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">Nyx nods and her equally crimson eyes flick over tot he scene.

You can set her on the couch there.&quot;** She nods her head towards the longer pale blue couch to her side, resting around the center of the room. 

She closes the tome in her hands and sets it aside, balancing it on the arm of her seat. She pushes up her glasses with a single finger before speaking again, directly to Vian. **&quot;Who are you and why are you carrying my unconscious girlfriend?&quot;** Her tone made it seem less a request for knowlege, and more of a demand her answer.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Ah.&quot;** Vian bows, carefully, while holding Arwyn.

The only person inside the circular room is a red tiefling woman sat in an armchair reading one of the many books that line the shelves that almost seem to serve as walls. Without looking up she asks. **&quot;Was there a reason for banging on my door like that?&quot;** Her tail flicks as she turns the page.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">It wasn&#x27;t long. Carefully carrying the long tailed dragonborn, he navigated the guild to bring her to her chambers. He rarely invited himself into a space without knocking first, and so spent the effort to give the door a good bash with his foot three times. It was rude to enter a space without permission after all, but this scenario was a bit out of the ordinary. He&#x27;d wait to see if there was a response, counting the time in his head.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-06-28</p> <p class="message">Nyx immediately mentally retorts back **&quot;Never contact me this way again unless it&#x27;s an emergency.&quot;** And she closes her book.

She&#x27;s ordered a scroll to enchant it months ago from Candlekeep, but it had only just recently come in, and given how &quot;busy&quot; she was with Arwyn, she&#x27;d only even more recently enchanted it. It was almost odd being fully clothed and *not* having her girlfriend&#x27;s hand up her dress. To be honest, she kind of missed the feeling of her tail around her, either around her own or her body. Nonetheless, she continues to read from her stack of books she had set out on the table, occasionally scrawling a relevant note. Good thing her scroll came with her new shipment of tomes, she&#x27;s read all the other ones several times by now.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-22</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-22</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn softens after there little exchange, but having a better feeling of what her lover wanted in bed, or on the couch, or anywhere else they decided to have at it. Honestly nowhere was safe, but for now she simply kissed her and walked over to the shower, closing the glass door behind them. She kissed her while they both rinsed in the steaming hot water, Arwyn enjoying the feeling as the warmth loosened her muscles. She then kissed Nyx across her cheeks, neck, shoulders, arms, and finally a few on every finger od her hands before grabbing the soap and lathering it across them both.

When she pulls back she becomes acutely aware of her thick tail snaking around her body as it tends to do on reflex. Her breath hitches, and then she smirks. She pats the side of her cheek twice with a cocky smile. **&quot;Now you get it.&quot;** She nods and wraps her arms around her neck again. **&quot;Now clean me and we can be off and do something other than fuck for a few hours.&quot;** She slides back into her arms and awaits to be pampered as she knows she will be.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-22</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn was shocked...but also aroused.

She brings her hands up beneath her chin as she nibbles on her neck, and, without warning, pushes up hard, causing her teeth to break skin and make her bleed slightly around the area. It was harder to notice given her skin tone, but she was bleeding now. She hisses lightly in pain and pleasure. **&quot;See? You can be rough with me, I won&#x27;t break. If we&#x27;re doing this.&quot;** She gestures back and forth between them. **&quot;Then I need to think your not going to coddle me.

Digging her face further into Arwyn&#x27;s neck she opens her maw and bites down on the sensitive skin, her fangs threatening to break skin.

She did let her tail uncoil from around the scholar though to let her know she was just playing, but it was still fun to tease her by rubbing her back lightly.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-06-22</p> <p class="message">After some more hours of sleep, Nyx&#x27;s eyes start to open slowly. A blurry sight, a mesh of purple hues. At first she was unsure what it was, one blink, two, nothing. It was then she noticed several things, as her wits began to catch up with her consciousness. Firstly, the familiar weight of her glasses was noticeably absent from her nose, second, the purple in front of her was warm and comfortable, third, she was cuddled up to Arwyn. Her senses start to flood back and she can feel their wrapped embrace in each other, a very gentle and caring warm. Nonetheless however, she can innately tell she&#x27;s been asleep much longer than planned. She pokes Arwyn&#x27;s tummy sharply to rouse her sleeping dragon, a groan escaping her lips. **&quot;Arwyn... ugh, get up.&quot;** She commands, sharply jabbing her again.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-14</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn struggled against whatever haunted her dreams but then...Nyx. She felt the other woman against her, felt her tail tighten around hers, and those words of affection, whether they be harsh or loving, they were most certainly Nyx showing her love for Arwyn. Her heart rate slowed, her breathing became less strained, and in her dream Nyx was there holding her. Except it wasn&#x27;t a dream, as much as it felt like one, it was real. She stopped struggling and tightened her grip around her love and slowly drifted back to peaceful sleep...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-06-14</p> <p class="message">A combination of exhaustion from having previously ignored sleep, combined with recent heavily involved physical activity with Arwyn, sex, meant Nyx was out much more so than usual. Subconsciously she was still aware of the squirming, and a part of her knew who it was by now, though frankly,she&#x27;d never even slept in the same bed as anyone by Arwyn. Her grip tightens around her and she snuggles into the crook of her neck, mumbling in her sleep. It wasn&#x27;t really intelligible, either &quot;shut up&quot; or &quot;I love you&quot;, both being profound statements Nyx was known to say often to her dragoness girlfriend, either or both was likely. Nonetheless she offers her unconscious comfort by pulling herself closer to her and wrapping their tails together, hoping somewhere in her sleeping mind that it would help her.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-14</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn slept against Nyx, another night...or day...or both of love making leaving them again weary. The two were close, snuggling, looking peaceful in one another&#x27;s arms. But then, Arwyn&#x27;s eyes scrunched tighter, and she started mumbling a bit in her sleep lightly. A few minutes passed and her heart picked up pace as the mumbling increased. Soon she started moving around, struggling in Nyx&#x27;s arms, her breathing picking up pace and tears forming in the corner&#x27;s of her eyes as a few words slipped through her sleeping lips.* **&quot;No...please...don&#x27;t...he&#x27;s just...he&#x27;s just...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-11</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-06-11</p> <p class="message">Fade to Black X: I Forgot How Many Times They&#x27;ve Done It</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-11</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-06-11</p> <p class="message">Nyx smiles and presses a kiss to the dragonborn&#x27;s lips, gripping the sides of her face to pull her closer.

She releases her lips with a small bite and pulls back, looming over her lover as her tail roams her inner thigh, brushing against the sensitive skin along the inside of her legs, working it&#x27;s way up ever so slowly. She leans forward again and whispers to her, a cocky and playful smirk on her lips. **&quot;Hope you didn&#x27;t have plans today, you&#x27;re not walking either after this.&quot;** And she latches back to her neck, leaving another mark.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-11</p> <p class="message">**&quot;...One minute.&quot;** *Arwyn leaps out of bed, does a backflip off the second floor, and disappears into the bathroom.

Her tail tightens around Arwyn&#x27;s and she wiggles in closer, her own hands starting to mimic her&#x27;s, slowly caressing up and down her soft scaled back, content to feel her as they just laid there. She was warm and like a big pillow you could cuddle up with, but better yet it cuddled back. She frequently used to sleep with a body pillow for the support, but she found that, since being with Arwyn, she didn&#x27;t need it anymore.

As those ten minute go on though Nyx wakes up more and becomes more active in wiggling in her arms. She starts to kiss along her neck, gently biting and sucking, leaving her marks on the woman, gently kissing any marred skin. She was careful with her fangs, small as they were, she imagined they would hurt if she tried. She just continues to hold her in place as she gives her hickey after hickey.

They had been together only for a relatively short time but already felt felt like she knew every inch of Nyx. Every little detail of her crimson skin, every curve of her body lithe figure, and even the how her muscles tensed with her movements. Yet even in all that she felt like there was more to find...more to learn...and not just about her body. She kissed her beautiful head and breathed in her strawberry hair and longed to know more of what she held inside.

She stirs from her slumber, becoming very aware of every inch of her body that&#x27;s pressed against her girlfriend, and how she was now even more acutely aware she didn&#x27;t want that to stop, she was tired, and she had no intention of sleeping alone. She nuzzles her face into her neck and presses featherlight kisses into the sensitive skin of the Dragonborn, wiggling her body and undulating in a way to signify how comfortable she was held in her arms.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-11</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn stirred in her sleep, feeling the warm, tender form of her girlfriend still in her arms.

She leaned in and kissed Nyx on the head, and then down to her ear, nibbling at her lobe ever so lightly to stir her from slumber without waking her up too quickly.

Just being close was enough for her, feeling every little breath she took, hearing every noise she made. It was bliss. It was peace. It made her feel whole for the first time in a long time. She could sleep when she was near Nyx, most of the time without the dreams haunting her. The dreams of that night. The night she...no...she pushed those thoughts away and just focused on the woman in her arms.

She&#x27;s snuggled in nice and tight with her as she nuzzles Arwyn in her sleep, the lullaby feeling nice in her sleep state. She settles down once she has her dragonborn and drifts into a peaceful sleep, an iron tight grip around Arwyn, loose enough for her to be comfortable, but there was little chance at escape.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-08</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn reads lightly but hears Nyx moving and looks up to see her reaching. She quickly puts the book away and moves to the other side of the bed, reaching to take Ny&#x27;x hand to let her know she is there. To let her know she&#x27;s on her way. She gets under the blankets and slides closer, letting Nyx cuddle up to her in whatever way made her comfortable. She always let her have her way, but the was fine, so long as she was happy. Once she&#x27;s comfy Arwyn gives her another kiss on the forehead and hums little lullaby lightly, more so Nyx can feel the vibrations in her chest than hearing it with her ears.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-06-08</p> <p class="message">Nyx stirs lightly in her sleep as she&#x27;s laid in bed and stripped comfortably by her girlfriend. It doesn&#x27;t bother her, and by this point, she&#x27;s deep in days lost sleep. Staying up studying the theoreticals of magical theory, as well as dutiful note taking had left her quite tired, given she&#x27;d done it for two nights straight. Well, that was about the only straight thing to do with her though. The rest of her life, despite her lawful nature, was odd and chaotic. Sans her studying, this guild had proven to be interesting, and her new relationship even more so. She wouldn&#x27;t trade it for anything though, and to keep Arywn she&#x27;d give anything. So in her sleep, she reaches out to the other side of the bed, clearly expecting, or wanting, her warm purple dragon girl to cuddle up next to, to press herself against, and snuggle in with.

She was always gorgeous, even while sleeping, and watching her slumber was a privilege in and of itself. She took her drowsy lover over to her bed, or rather there bed she supposed, and laid her down. She slowly and carefully removed Nyx&#x27;s clothes, doing everything she could to not wake her, before finally covering her up with several blankets. Some people liked being cozy, but Nyx liked being in an inferno of blankets, quilts, and whatever else she could cover herself with. Finally she removed Nyx&#x27;s glasses and placed them on her night stand, fetching a glass of water for her just in case she woke up thirsty. She ran a hand through her lady&#x27;s hair ever so gently and kissed her forehead before taking off her own clothes. She changed into a simple undershirt and shorts before grabbing a book from the pile of &quot;acceptable&quot; volumes Nyx had chosen for her before hand, pulling up a chair next to the bed and opening it to where she left off.*

It started out worse than just after showering, it used to be all the time. I couldn&#x27;t wear clothes with ease until I was around 12ish if I recall correctly. Before then I would spend any time I didn&#x27;t have to waste with my useless tutors in my room naked so my skin didn&#x27;t burst out too bad. I&#x27;m serious when I say I believe it&#x27;s a succubus back in my infernal line, one in service to Asmodeus. That or my bloodline is older and was changed with the Mark of Asmodeus, no matter though. It was strange yes but.. but it hurt a lot, and it was embarrassing, having my mother *see* me like that for so long but there was nothing I could do, and she would say horrible things day in and out...&quot;** She sighs, she didn&#x27;t know when she started gripping Arwyn&#x27;s hands so tightly, but she was. **&quot;My skin got better as I got older, and by 6 I could wear them enough to be around people, so long as I went as long without them otherwise, and each year meant I could stand them longer, like my infernal blood was being diluted a little each day. Well, I&#x27;m fine now, and it&#x27; s mostly for comfort purposes but.. but I shouldn&#x27;t have snapped at you I.. I don&#x27;t want you to hate me, despite who and how I am.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn&#x27;s arms suddenly wrapped around Nyx, meeting across her stomach as she just held her for a moment.* **&quot;No, I&#x27;m sorry.

She slides on her dress and shoes quickly, not wanting to make a show, feeling.. weird, not good weird. Arwyn made her feel good weird, she deduced that much, this was bad weird.. the kind  her parents had a hand in. For a brief moment she wonders if she made a mistake opening up. All these emotions and memories were closer to the surface now but.. but no. It wasn&#x27;t a mistake, it was for, it was *with*, her partner and.. and snapping at her was wrong and made her feel worse? Old Nyx would detest new Nyx but frankly, old Nyx was a cunt and new Nyx cared about her partner, she could easily deduce that she made her feel better as well, all of this was better, a vast improvement, as always with her. **&quot;Sorry..

She squeezes her again, she didn&#x27;t want her to go and she couldn&#x27;t make herself say it, so instead she does her best to show it. She opens her eyes back up and even though it&#x27;s a blurry mess without her glasses, even more so after crying, she knew she was there, that purple blob was safety, was comfort.

Cried for Nyx and...maybe for herself. She thought about the mother she never knew, the dreams that had been crushed by reality, and the loneliness she had inflicted upon herself. And now here was the person she had wanted to help escape all that trying to calm her down. Trying to ease her mind. Trying to show emotions she didn&#x27;t even know how to yet. Arwyn even barely knew herself how to...they really were perfect for each other.*

*She reached a hand up and ran it through Nyx&#x27;s hair and another held onto her back as she cried with her beloved. She didn&#x27;t stop knowing if she did, Nyx might as well, and they NEEDED this. Both of them, more than even Arwyn knew. They needed to feel.

Her nails dig into her scales a little, but Nyx doesn&#x27;t even notice, she&#x27;s too busy crying over her lost childhood and innocence that she never had the chance to have. She was never given the chance to be a kid or feel loved or wanted, she was robbed of it the day she was born. Even as she wept over it into her partner&#x27;s arms she was just coming to terms with this slowly. She felt.. she felt it would more many more cries and talks before she really could grasp this trauma but.. but right now was enough. 

Her tail stays tightly wound around Arwyn&#x27;s, equally unwilling to let goof the woman on top of her. Part way through she can finally manage to hear Arwyn&#x27;s tears and.. and they break her heart like she didn&#x27;t think possible. That was the worst sound in the world it.. was only logical that.. no, no she wouldn&#x27;t make up an excuse for this. She wanted to make Arwyn stop crying because she.. she.. she doesn&#x27;t know. But care, she cares about her, that would do for now.. She wiggles her way up to her face and opens her eyes, still sobbing. Her vision was blurry, but the purple blur in her vision was Arwyn and.. Gods only a week ago she&#x27;d be looking at herself right now with disdain but, but she felt she was more right now than then. **&quot;Sh-hh-hh.. I-I&#x27;m here too.. y-you can let i-it out too...&quot;** She doesn&#x27;t know what to say, so she tries to change what she was told to work for her, but the words were no less genuine.

The more Nyx cried the more she cried, and honestly that was when she knew it for sure, the feeling she had inside of her. The feeling she believed was in both of them. But it was too soon to tell her. Too soon to force her to confront those feelings. There was so much more for them to work through. So much more they both needed to get out into the air. She whispered to the woman in her arms with nothing but tenderness. Nothing but empathy. Nothing but...Love.*

As she feels Arwyn&#x27;s hot breath on her face, and them her lips on her own, she feel ready to cry almost. She doesn&#x27;t know it yet, but she plucked a chord in the weave of her heart, playing it like a harp with the same grace she played to weave and molded it into magic. For a moment when they separate for breath she&#x27;s left heaving, a few tears in the corner&#x27;s of her eyes she&#x27;s not even aware of. She raises a curled figure to her lips, that one felt different and.. and she couldn&#x27;t make herself think this was part of any experiment anymore. That kiss was so much more than exploring feeling it was.. she doesn&#x27;t know. It bugs her that she doesn&#x27;t and dedicates herself to learning what it was.

It was a familiar feeling; one of anger toward people. She didn&#x27;t hate people per-say but, well, maybe sometimes she did! It seemed like for every one good thing people would do for one another they would end up doing ten horrible things to make up the difference. At least that was how she felt sometimes, and she hated that feeling. Feeling Nyx next to her helped though, a lot, and she gave her another little kiss to let her know she was still there. Being so close though there probably would have been a moment when she would have felt her heart beat a little faster as she spoke. As the anger toward Nyx&#x27;s parents welled up in her.

She twists her body, shifting so her back was pressed against Arwyn&#x27;s tones stomach and ample chest, wrapped up in her arms and tail. It was certainly a very unique feeling, a warm blanked, her tail around her waist, her arms around her chest, feeling her breath against her back it was.. comforting. There were clearly a lot of unknown variables here and effects at that, ones she had a desire to know and understand, and that would require a consistent partner. No one else appealed to her so Arwyn would have to do for all of them she supposed, or so she lied to herself. That little quiet part of her brain was melting with how happy it was and deep down she knew that she wanted to be with Arwyn, and that her arms here the safest and most wonderful place in the world, but that part was tragically too quiet for her to consciously realize this fully. Nonetheless she snuggles in and opens the book, letting the blanket fall away from her chest, but the warmth of Arwyn made of for the loss. 

The book was titled &quot;Magical Signatures: A Treatise on the Importance of Personalizing Your Casting Method and Making the Fundamentals Yours.&quot; She had read it before, but felt that rereading it would lead to improving her form and technique, given that she had a little more practical experience under her belt.

Arwyn was in the same boat. A very small boat. A very small couch shaped boat. She shook her head slightly, her mind wandering. She had a bomb ass woman in her arms who was able to keep waits with her, made her want to better herself, needed someone in her life as much as she did, and on too of all that had a body that wouldn&#x27;t stop!

Even now her thoughts were turning to new ways she could make love to the librarian. New ways they could enjoy one another. She felt like they had missed a step though. Most people...dated and stuff before ever even kissing, right? Then again she supposed the two of them had been dating for years without even realizing it. There various encounters at Candlekeep, working together on projects willingly or otherwise, and of course getting in and out of trouble in their own ways. She still remembered that time when they were teenagers and Nyx convinced Arwyn with little more than the promise of a free pastry to help her break into the archive of a well known Archmage just so she could cross reference a single word in a 500 year old tome because she believed her copy to be a forgery. And she had been right! She as usually right. Hearing her mention spells that could let her do...things, Arwyn&#x27;s mind started racing, as did her pulse.

What she figured would be this one time act of impulse was now, apparently becoming something more...long term. The notion of them being girlfriends didn&#x27;t immediately register. No, this was just Nyx needing someone for things she clearly needed to explore and understand! Arwyn was the perfect person to help her with that! Laid back, uncoothe, emotionally inept Arwyn. Nothing to see here. Not a thing.*

*...Right? Is that what Nyx wanted? Was that what she wanted? She wasn&#x27;t sure, but she knee one thing for sure...she wanted to hold Nyx. And hold her. And hold her some more. She wanted them to be next to one another as often as possible. To read together, pester one another, argue until they were blue in the face, and then fall asleep in one another&#x27;s arms.

Stepping our of the bathroom door and onto the base floor of her room, her hair still damp and a tower wrapped around her body, she pulls Arwyn next to her out as well. They still had their hands clasped together, and Nyx chalked it up to make sure the other one was steady, a safety measure. Either way she makes no hint she wants to let go and any point, and drags the similarly damp Arwyn over to a couch, where she plops them both down. Her breathing is still definitely heavy, and after all the very rigorous and constant &quot;research&quot; she could feel her muscles ache. She had never done anything like this, with herself or others, and now suddenly it&#x27;d been three times and she was panting from it. She flops over and rests her head in Arwyn&#x27;s lap, her wet hair soaking her couch and her thighs, but she didn&#x27;t have the energy to care at the moment, she&#x27;d clean it with magic later. **&quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been much academic value to what we&#x27;ve spent half the day doing Arwyn.&quot;** She states, sounding serious.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message">Fade to Black 3: The Hot Wet One</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message">*OH WOW!

She didn&#x27;t get it still, she&#x27;d never once in her life found herself wanting or craving affection, touch.. and more intimate activities, with anyone. She&#x27;s always preferred to be by herself, left to her own devices to study, and yet here she was. Sweaty, panting, and laying naked on top of a woman who she had expended a great many favors to keep near her for a while now. It doesn&#x27;t make sense, she doesn&#x27;t even know when these weird feeling started, and she doesn&#x27;t know why. Maybe, she begins to try and concoct an excuse, her body was so pent up from years of her ignoring basic urges one feels that, now that she could have it, she needed to get it out, yes! Indeed, surely that was it, and not some underlying love for the woman under her, totally not, no way, none whatsoever, for sure... Her trying to convince herself that aside, this gave her a perfectly good reason to keep her around. Nyx would need this again and she could confidently say she trusted Arwyn more than anyone else, though that wasn&#x27;t saying too much given her general disposition towards others. But, she would have these urges again and Arwyn could help her with them and more minor ones, such as for affection. Likely she had come to this conclusion too and Arwyn could stand to benefit in the same way, it was only logical that they stay together and provide for each other like this. It would allow her research to flourish if she had a healthy outlet for these feelings.. Surely that was the only reason.. right? Something in her didn&#x27;t want to say this rationalization out loud and.. and she doesn&#x27;t know why, but she doesn&#x27;t, it just.. felt bad in her chest the thought of saying that to her. Probably just post-coital adrenaline surely.

She snakes a hand up from Arwyn&#x27;s butt, where it was clasped, and all the way to her cheek.

She could easily see her scales were less pronounced, much more subtle, than most dragonborn. Still, running her hand down her side, briefing over her stomach down her navel, and to her back again, taking a firm grasp of her surprisingly plump butt, it was all much smoother than she could have imagined. Something only real in-depth hands on research could have told her. Her tail as well was much more flexible, smooth, and gentle than she imagined it to be, had she always been like this? No matter, an odd feeling popping up in her chest made itself clear it didn&#x27;t want to separate from Arwyn, and if she did then she&#x27;d have to *keep* feeling it and it would distract her all day. The only logical thing to do was simple however, just don&#x27;t. **&quot;Together, after last night, I&#x27;m not sure how steady my legs will be, and on top of that I need to make sure you follow proper hygienic routines. The last thing I, or you need, is for either of us to be dirty should we conduct more research. It&#x27;s only the healthiest option as well, we can conserve water too this way.&quot;** She rationalizes out loud, the small quiet part of her head knowing how ridiculous she sounded.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message">*She reciprocates...maybe a little more than she should before nuzzling the other girl&#x27;s cheek.* **&quot;Okay, you be smart.

Oh she would later though. It was going to hit her like a ton of bricks and leave her dazed for days on end as she tried to figure how the crap this had happened, or how she could prevent it from happening again. Or...if she even wanted to. Damn. Her dad had warned her about shit like this, but of course she didn&#x27;t listen...again. Man she tasted good though...* **&quot;This is dumb.

Partner, sure, it was a versatile word, did it mean research partner, adventuring partner, partner in crime.. romantic and sexual partner.. who knows? She rolls her eyes though at the sound. **&quot;Typical..&quot;** She mutters under her breath and raises a hand from around her back to her face just above her. She begins to stroke along the spot she remembers having slapped her, running her thumb over the side of her face tenderly. She was.. groggy, and tired, that&#x27;s why she was acting like this surely. Although, even she knows she doesn&#x27;t have an excuse for the rigorous and extremely passionate and.. emotional, sex they&#x27;d had. No that one would require a much more elaborate excuse, as even now her brain was realizing there was no scientific or academic merits to any of the things they did in bed last night.

Nonetheless she doesn&#x27;t detach herself from the former Avowed.. she had said she wasn&#x27;t allowed to go anywhere until she could figure out they&#x27;re feelings about each other so.. it would be unfair to her.. partner.. if she did so, right?

She doesn&#x27;t like it and lets out a little sound if protest only to have the warmth return. She smiles in her sleep and gently pulls the warmth closer, burying her face in a soft sea of crimson and taking a deep breath. The smell is wonderful. The warmth is wonderful. The tender lips against her skin are wonderful. Realization strikes her and her eyes open slowly as she realizes she wasn&#x27;t in a dream and glances down to see Nyx in her arms. She is both alarmed and perplexed by this, knowing it couldn&#x27;t be real, and yet it was. She just lays there for a moment before closing her eyes and just taking another breath. Five more minutes wouldn&#x27;t hurt...right? Weird that her vision was so blurry though...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message">Nyx&#x27;s eyes flutter open as the first rays of daylight sneak through the blinds in her room. The small rays of warms cast upon her bare smooth vermillion skin. At first all she can see is a deep blurry purple, and then she can feel pressure against her naked body, an odd and new sensation at that. Her mind quickly catches up with her though as she recalls the events of the previous night, and how Arwyn and her spent in the throes of passion, and suddenly she becomes accutely aware of her body and the one snuggles up to her. The pressure atop her head tells her she&#x27;s nestled herself in the crook of Arwyn&#x27;s neck, hence one of two reasons her vision was blurry, the other being her distinct lack of glasses. She remembers having removed them before going to sleep last night, having worn them all through her guided research into the emotions they were both experiencing. As she can feel the rise and fall of Arwyn&#x27;s chest against her own though, and the firm but gentle arms wrapped around her in tandem with the pressure of her chin on her head, it strikes up an odd emotion in her again. She truly didn&#x27;t know what she was feeling, and it was only in the groggy morning could she even admit to herself properly that she wanted this girl with her for more selfish reasons than research.

Stirring lightly she tries to maneuver her head out of the nook she&#x27;s buried herself into. She&#x27;s only so successful as to be able to twist her back enough to feel around her bedside table for her glasses, though she is unsuccessful in finding them. She sighs and sinks back into the embrace, becoming more aware the other girl had them in a position to have as much of their bodies in contact as possible, typical. But, she figured, a good research partner was hard to come by, and she supposed she can lay here with her a while longer, certainly not because she secretly wanted to, how ridiculous. So she buries her head back in the crook of her neck, placing her lips gently to the soft scaled skin.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message">Fade to black</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message">Nyx smiles into the renewed kiss.

Whatever, eventually Arwyn pulled away to, breathing heavily and heart pounding in her chest. She was burning and knew she needed to stop this, now! She needed to leave and get as far away from Nyx as possible before she screwed something up for her. Before this moment of passion, and apparently several emotions that had been going on in the tiefling for a while now, turned into something neither of them would easily be able to escape from!*

**&quot;I missed you so much. I thought I wouldn&#x27;t...that I&#x27;d be able to let go...but you&#x27;re so...oh wow you smell good!&quot;**

The feeling is wholly foreign to her. At first she&#x27;s simply stunned by the incredibly bold gesture following the her statement, and her mind was racing. *What the fuck does she mean she would have ruined everything? Why are her lips so soft? What did any of this mean? When were they so pressed against each other? When did their tails wrap together..* Her eyes slowly flutter closed on some latent reflex as she stays still, returning the kiss, even if she didn&#x27;t really get why.

Once she get&#x27;s the chance, they both needed air at some point, she pulls back, a single strand of saliva still connecting their lips. For a moment she just breaths heavily, her chest heaving against Arwyn&#x27;s. Then, she wrenches her hand from the monk&#x27;s and slaps her across the face.. hard. **&quot;What the fuck?!&quot;** She yells again, but doesn&#x27;t move her face far from Arwyn&#x27;s, feeling her hot breath on her. **&quot;I can handle myself thank you very much.

She knew. She always knew. But she didn&#x27;t want to accept it because she felt like it would do nothing but hold her back. She wanted to see Nyx happy. To see her become the best damn wizard on the planet. Not because she felt like she was the only one that could, or because she was the only one who had the potential. No, it was because Nyx was the first honest to God person Arwyn had ever met who she felt was worth trying to help achieve it. The former Avowed had left for a lot of reasons, one of which was a fear of holding Nyx back, because even though she wouldn&#x27;t admit it, even though she denied it even then in that moment, Arwyn knew what was coming and was scared she wouldn&#x27;t be able to stop it.*

*And she was right.*

It really did have a mind of its own sometimes...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-26</p> <p class="message">Nyx feels thee butterflies too as Arwyn&#x27;s hands wrap around her hips and lift her up, but she manages to convince herself it&#x27;s her minor case of altophobia. She reaches up and grabs the first tome that looks like it would be of use to the subject at hand &quot;Ki Manipulation: A Practical Guide of Manipulating Other&#x27;s Ki With Your Own&quot;. Though again, Nyx was no warrior monk, and had no interest in perusing such, she had purchased the book in a cross study on Ki and The Weave, believing if she could understand the ways in which Ki and The Weave were similar, that it would lead her to unique insights for her studies. She was right of course, and though Ki and the arcane were not the same, the art of manipulating Ki and The Weave was similar at their basics, and it did indeed improve her own techniques for plucking the strings of The Weave. 

As she&#x27;s thinkin about this she doesn&#x27;t notice her tail wrap itself around Arwyn&#x27;s arm, but by the time she has, she rationalizes it back to her phobia. Wrapping her tail around something provided a sense of stability, even if it wasn&#x27;t quite real. But the sense of security was much more than a placebo, but the part of her brain that new that once more was not very vocal. **&quot;Put me down now.&quot;** She demands, tucking the book under her arm.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-26</p> <p class="message">*She wasn&#x27;t wrong about that, the temptation to rearrange a few books in Hope&#x27;s of aggravating monks that weren&#x27;t even there being quite strong. Maybe she had a problem? Nah, they were the ones with the problem of being stuck so far up their own asses...she was getting distracted. Arwyn shrugged and walked over, totally not letting butterflies roll around in her stomach as she leaned down and wrapped her hands around Nyx&#x27;s thighs, lifting her up a bit to help her reach the book. The dragonborn wasn&#x27;t the physically strongest but she could handle something like this and was surprisingly toned but still smooth skinned. Her scales had always been smaller and closely connected making for a less rugged feel. It didn&#x27;t hurt that she moisturized regualarly either...which was probably why the scent of lavender seemed to follow her around...probably.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-26</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Up here on the-&quot;** She steps up on a step stool to reach the top shelf, being much taller than her 5&#x27;6 frame could reach. Yet, as she puts her weight on the wooden object, it breaks under her and she stumbles back. She catches herself easily enough on the railing, but she looks more disappointed in the stool than shook up from nearly falling. **&quot;Figures, cheap piece of garbage they try and push on us. That&#x27;s the third of those from Candlekeep that&#x27;s snapped in half.&quot;** She pinches her nose again, a common gesture from her honestly. She crosses her arms and looks up to the shelf, deciding to later go shopping for a more sturdily crafted stool. She looks over to Arwyn and taps her foot impatiently. **&quot;Make yourself useful and lift me up, I don&#x27;t trust you to *even* touch my own collection with how much you&#x27;ve fucked the organization at Candlekeep, over and over and over.&quot;** She glares at the former avowed, knowing just what horrible things she would do to her collection if she had the opportunity.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-26</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn saw her in the light and tried to look away but found herself...impressed. She shook her head and forced away the thought. Crap, Nyx had always been attractive but Arwyn tended to be able to ignore it for the most part. It was like admiring the dawn or dusk; they weren&#x27;t things to obtain, just to look at from a distance and enjoy quietly. Nyx was fun to pester and just be around, at least for Arwyn, but she had never really seen her as much more than that; someone she enjoyed being around. But now, in this moment...maybe it was just this place bringing back memories, or the fact she had been reading classic romance all day. Yeah, that was it, of course it was.* **&quot;So...where are the book I should be reading&quot;** *She says casually trying to act cool.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-26</p> <p class="message">**&quot;There are plenty, but that&#x27;s partially a part of expanding my magical reptoir through practical field testing. To advance my knowledge of the arcane now it will take such field experience and more dedicated in depth study. It&#x27;s to make sure I can handle the amounts of the weave I plan to shape and bend. The only way to do it with more ease is to do it more, and , having extra money on the side, seeing practical relevance of spells, and so on is all very important for the study.&quot;** She explains, completely oblivious to  the fact Arwyn was uncomfortable with how much like Candlekeep her room was. Nyx liked it very much this was, so it wasn&#x27;t a concern on her mind.

Once at the top of the stairs she steps forward to the railing and ledge overlooking the bottom floor, providing her draconic companion the room to get up, given it was a narrow space. The upper level is a thin ring around more shelves lined with books, much the same as before, though this had a soft off white carpet as opposed to the hardwood bottom floor. On the wall above where her desk was is a portion carved out, inside which is her bed. A fairly simple deep red canopy bed rests in the nook, bedside table piled on with papers and various books and notes left out for her late night readings. **&quot;Though even if I could, even I need to rest my eyes from reading print all day. I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s bad in the long-term and I was born needing these to begin with, no need to push my luck and pay for a pricy restoration from a cleric if I can avoid it.&quot;** she pushes up her glasses again to make her point, the light streaming through the windows gleaming off them for a moment. Furthermore, the light in the room almost made her shimmer a little, the gold was more emphasized against her red base, and it was obvious how soft and well cared for her hair was. Her golden jewelry, both on her horns and ears glimmer as well in the atmosphere the room provided.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-26</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn followed behind her, not enjoying being back in a place so similar to home. Home...could it even have been called that? Well Nyx thought so, but then a place like that was perfect for her. A place where she could have all the research materials she could ever need and then some while focusing completely on her work and not having to worry about the normal woes and responsibilities of life. In a way Arwyn wished she could have been like that, even if only because it would have made life easier in a way. But she wasn&#x27;t...she wasn&#x27;t sure what she was anymore. She shook her head and tried to clear her thoughts, realizing Nyx had mentioned leisurely reading as a hobby. She knew her idea of such things was probably advanced magical theorem that would make Arwyn loose consciousness after two sentences, but the fact the concept of hobbies even had room in the big pretty head of hers was...interesting.* **&quot;You sleep? I figured you would have found a way around that by now.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-26</p> <p class="message">**&quot;No, but that would have been preferred. I called in a favor with Artsia Twice Dead for her to transport my collection here, as well as several bits of my furniture and the like using her demiplane.&quot;** Artsia was another wizard in the Avowed, a halfling necromancer, but she did have more generalist options. She wasn&#x27;t the most popular, but she was reliable, and if she owed you something she would make sure you got it. **&quot;So I brought what of my things I could, but the rest of the room luckily feel enough like the keep to me.&quot;** She closes the door and moves further into the room.

She approaches a set of stairs that spirals around half the room up to the top floor. The inner walls were equally full to the brim with books shelves lines with such. She waves Arwyn over to follow her impatiently and begins to ascend. **&quot;The books containing information on Ki are on the upper floor. I figured it would make more sense to arrange my room down up since I plan to spend most of my time researching the topics most important to me, such as magical theory, basics, spell sigils, and so on, at my desk down here. Material I consider to be more interested in as a hobby is up here so I can read it in bed and relax with it easier.&quot;** She rambles on. She enjoyed her own organization system a lot, it was efficient and smart to her needs. She doubted heavily Arwyn cared but explaining it made sense if she was to be using it. Besides, she thought, the girl already knew her, she knew how she was. Nyx never felt a need to put on false pretenses for her to aid in smoothing over most interactions. She got the genuine Nyx, while many got a very practiced calm and polite Nyx, the one her parents would have gotten if they had their way. It was useful enough a mask though, most people reacted poorly, such as Rhogar, to how she actually was. This didn&#x27;t bother the librarian however, but sometimes she needed someone to be more passive to her.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-25</p> <p class="message">*Arwyn steps in and instantly recognizes the feel and smell of the room. It was the sort that she had lived all her life in, only escaping it on the occasion of a mission for her order or special requests from Seekers the other monks would claim had earned the privilege of such assistance. She scrunched her nose but tried to hide her discomfort from Nyx, even if only a little, though the wizard knew exactly how she felt about such things.* **&quot;Geez Nyx; did you just take a chunk of the Keep and bring it with you?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-25</p> <p class="message">Nyx steps into the ring-shaped room. Shelves full of books line the curved walls, and the ground floor is further decorated with simple, yet elegantly simple, furniture as well as a desk from which to work. It was clearly her desk, as multiple tomes lay open with several notebooks laid beside them with half-finished notes, waiting for her to return and complete the material and absorb it&#x27;s knowledge. She ignores the allure of returning to study for now and taps her foot impatiently, waiting for Arwyn to step inside. **&quot;Are you coming in or what?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-05-23</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/713800436032995438/713800685438894090/dam-images-decor-libraries-library-01-katherine-newman.png"/></li>
