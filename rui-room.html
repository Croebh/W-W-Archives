**&quot;Oh does she?&quot;** *Chloe asked straightly.*

**&quot;OH come on! She gets eldritched up and I get in trouble for wearing thigh highs!?&quot;** *Elfrida screams with clear annoyance.*

**&quot;THIGH HIGHS!?&quot;** *Chloe yelled out with eyes wide as she looked toward her sister before chasing her around the room.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*She smiled as she just got kissed and then held as she smiled.* **”Thanks...oh?

It was a gentle, loving kiss followed by her hugging her back, holding her close.* **&quot;Okay.&quot;**

*Elfrida&#x27;s jaw dropped but she honestly wasn&#x27;t surprised in the least. She just rolled her eyes and fell back onto the bed, letting out a long groan.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*She gave a nod.* **”Yes it is.”** *She then reached around and hug Chloe.* **”They are my friend Chloe.

It had been a year and she knew the voice as she began to breathe in.  This is going to be very bad!*

Take it slow and easy.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*That was true, she hadn&#x27;t been. She barely knew Lace or anything about their condition, but that was more reason for her to feel the way she did. She didn&#x27;t know Lace, but she knew Rui, so worrying about her was easier. Elfrida wasn&#x27;t the sort to think about saving the world and only focused on the people right in front of her. But...she supposed that was what Rui did. She saw Lace and wanted to help them if she could in some way, even if it meant putting herself on the line. It just...it wasn&#x27;t something Elfrida knew what to do with. She didn&#x27;t know how to react. She was just...scared.* **&quot;Rui I...&quot;**

*The doorknob raddled as someone stuck a key in, turning the knob to enter.* **&quot;Starlight! I got take out!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*She paused as she gripped her pen.* **”I know!  Alright!”** *As she began to get upset* **”I know it’s a dumb idea!  I know it’s horrible!  But...You haven’t been around Lace like I have...seen things with them.  Been there...it’s horrible.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I just...I don&#x27;t get how you having it helps them! I mean I&#x27;m no expert on medicine or whatever but it just seems like there are TWO sick people now who need a cure!&quot;** *She was upset, a lot, not mad or disappointed but...scared. She was scared for Rui, and scared for Chloe to.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*She gave a nod as she began to wrap back up her arm.* **”Also can do this.”** *As she began to look over to Elf marks grew on her face as well as her Brown single Iris went into 3 green ones* **”I know it’s bad and stupid...but..I wanted to help them out.

Like, she knew Rui studied medicine to help people, but this was a bit much! Okay A LOT MUCH! It was one thing to be selfless for the sake of someone else but...but...* **&quot;Knowing Chloe she&#x27;ll support you regardless, that&#x27;s who she is, but damn Rui...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">**”It’s been a year Elf...like a long year...”** *She let out a sigh as she removed her her bandaids as her tattooed right arm was covered with marks.* **”She doesn’t know yet.  Or even Camille I have been...focused on other issues.”** *She let out a sigh.* **”They don’t harm anyone...just can’t do anything without the bandaids.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*Elfrida&#x27;s eyes widened as she heard this, not even sure how to respond. She did what, for who? Lace...right the tabaxi they met back at the Roxalire guild. They were creeeeeepy but kind of nice to. Still, why would she do something like this exactly? Why would anyone willingly do something like that?! But then a thought crossed her mind, and it scared her...a lot.* **&quot;Does Chloe know?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*She frowned as she began to feel like she was being grilled.  She then made a sigh.* **”I...had a chat with Lace.  And opted to be infected with their disease.  To help them out.  Go ahead and yell at me like everyone else is.”** *She kept at working as she began to read up more and more.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*Elfrida just narrowed her vision toward the other girl, her stare intense. She could tell SOMETHING was up, and whatever that something was it had Rui acting secretive.* **&quot;You know I used to run with thugs, criminals, and ne&#x27;er do wells right Rui? And they were ALL better liars than you.&quot;** *Elfrida sat on the bed with arms and legs both crossed, just watching Rui ever so closely.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*Rui smiled as she began to think about it.* **”Hey!  I wore white and it’s fine it will look cute on ya.”** *She then began to nodded.* **”Just...work stuff.”** *Her tone wasn’t as open as before as she was doing research in her room.* **”Yeah I am fine...but umm...”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh come on I can rock black fine! Ugh, fine, white. Even you&#x27;re a prude...&quot;** *Elfrida let out an annoyed sigh, looking toward Rui and noticing she was a lot more dressed then usual. Like half the time when she&#x27;s lounging the monk is in the bare essentials, yet here she was covering up a lot. Maybe too much.* **&quot;You feeling okay Ru?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*She chuckled softly as she began to move over to one of her draws.

Got some new shorts and I want to make Chloe have conniptions about the way I dress.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*She was working at something at her desk as she heard the knocking before she turned over.* **”Oh the door is open!  Please come in.”** *She rather made sure her arm was tightly wrapped up as well as the green marks and three irises gone as well.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">&lt;@!446205770250584065&gt;</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*There was rapid knocking at Rui&#x27;s door as Elfrida stood on the other side, ~~being a little shit~~ needing something from her soon to be sister in law.* **&quot;Rui.

What was so special about today? Nothing much really. So why was she wearing her form fitting blue dress and ankle strap short heels? Because she felt like it that&#x27;s why! The fact was she, Rui, and Camille hadn&#x27;t had a chance to get together and do much of late due to...many thing, and Chloe just felt like she needed to do something special for her fiances! So by God she was going to try and do something nice for them! She even put on lip stick!!! LIP STICK!!! She was terrible with makeup but she made it work (Thank you SO MUCH ELFRIDA and ARTORIA!!!). She took a deep breath, reached up, and knocked on her girlfriend&#x27;s door.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-08-03</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-08-02</p> <p class="message">*She is able to easily fall asleep again.

That only made a feeling rise up in Chloe though, but it was a different sort. It was a desire to protect Rui. To protect everyone she could. She picked Rui up and took her over to the bed, laying her down before getting in beside her. She held onto the sleeping woman, staying by her side and shrouding her with love. It was love that would save them. Love that would shield them from harm. But for now...they could just rest...even if only for the moment.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-08-02</p> <p class="message">**”I feel...something in the pit of my stomach as well.”** *She lets out a sigh.

These memories...her past in general, it seemed like it was all coming back to haunt her now for some reason. Maybe it was because of her new found relationships, like something having been triggered, or even something small that was subconsciously haunting her. Whatever the case Chloe knew something like this wasn&#x27;t healthy for her beloved, mentally or physically, and that she wanted to help her. But right now she just held tight to her while letting her rest.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-08-02</p> <p class="message">**”Morninf Angel....I just been having nightmares again....I see my old family and my master telling me what I should done....and remembering my puberty years...I don’t know why but it seems as though more memories are flooding in.”** *She puts her head on Chloe’s neck holding the woman tight to her* **”I just need a few minutes.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-08-02</p> <p class="message">*She kissed her gently.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll stay for longer than that if you need me...or even just want me to.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-08-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hey Starlight...&quot;** *, is all Chloe says as she nuzzle Rui a bit, just holding onto her and gently messaging her arms.

This was...something was wrong. This wasn&#x27;t normal, not for Rui. She puts the doughnuts down, slipped off her boots, and went over to where Rui was curled up. She grabbed a blanket from off the bed along the way and then took a seat, getting close to her girlfriend and wrapping it around them both as she curled up next to her. She just held her there, wanting the first thing she felt when she woke up to be love.

She she would regret it later, but she was going to eat the tar out of these with her girl friends. Her...three girlfriends. Huh. She eventually makes it to Rui&#x27;s room and knocks a few time before getting her keys out, wondering if she was even home.

She wasn&#x27;t sure what to call it even, but as it swelled inside of her she could help but starts crying...and smiling.

It would be good to have her there beside them...to be together even in combat.* 

*Artoria heard this and felt...bad. She hadn&#x27;t be assigned to the guild war and honestly...she had been relieved. She had seen so much war in her life that the though of being sent into it again felt...wrong. Felt like a step backward. Yet knowing these three women would be going, putting their lives on the line to protect the place that had welcomed them all and given them a chance to be themselves, made her feel...like a coward. When she heard Rui though she looked up and reacted without a second thought, putting aside those feelings for the time being and focusing completely on the clearly upset woman before her.* **&quot;Of course! You&#x27;ve been here for me Rui...and I want to be here for you.&quot;** *She nuzzles Camille once more before getting up to go over to where Rui and Chloe sat, taking the chair on the other side of the girls and pressing herself into the former.

She might know someone who can help with...well...everything you&#x27;ve been through.&quot;** *She holds her tighter, trying to shield her even though what was tormenting her was inside the girl&#x27;s mind.* 

*Artoria could hear the strange change in Camille&#x27;s heart beat, pressing her head against the woman&#x27;s chest as best she could. That...didn&#x27;t seem good. She then heard what she had to say and closed her eyes for a second before sitting up and looking toward Rui with something like confidence as she spoke.* **&quot;I...when I first gained my freedom...I sought out a counselor. A few, as a matter of fact. They helped me in those early days to figure out some small things that helped me. Things that set the foundation for...well...being able to let go of the past. Of the things that were...and sometimes still do...hold me back. I can&#x27;t say I know what you&#x27;re going through, but finding someone to talk to about it is...it&#x27;s so important Rui.

I&#x27;ll let you know when I get ready to go.&quot;** *She answers genuinely but is also worried about Rui, letting her rest against her chest while stroking her softly. She had never seen her like this before, but she knew well that everyone had days like that. Days when bad memories or weariness got the better of them. She hoped that was all this was...but...Rui had always spoken of her master with such high regard. For thoughts of him to be causing this sort of reaction...* **&quot;Is it saying...good things?&quot;** *She figured it probably wasn&#x27;t...but she didn&#x27;t really know how else to ask about something like that.*

*Artoria breathed against Camille, hearts in her eyes as she took in the full feeling of the kiss they had shared. She...she needed a second to...to...process. Honestly though she just wanted to kiss more, to feel Camille&#x27;s cold hands against her back. and her warm chest against her own. It was a lot of sensations to take in, and her body and heart were telling her they were all good ones. She did snap out of it though, even if only for a second, looking over to see Rui and Chloe holding each other. Even from where she sat she could tell something was amiss and looked up to Camille and over at Chloe again before speaking up suddenly.* **&quot;I-I&#x27;ll stay with miss Rui! I mean...I&#x27;ll keep her company today while you two are out. It&#x27;s the least I can do...no...I want to.

Panties and a tank top, at least for now. She looked over to Rui and smiled before walking over to take a seat next to her first girlfriend.* **&quot;What do you think?

*Chloe soon emerges from the shower in a towel while drying her hair, walking over to give Rui a long kiss on the cheek...then her neck...then her shoulder.

Closing her eyes...and smiling.  &quot;RUI!  YOU ARE A FAILURE!  YOU DIDNT DO ANYTHING RIGHT!&quot;  The voice in the back of her head...a masculine voice.

Camille&#x27;s eyes slowly opened, the turquoise irises glowing slightly... flashing amber for a moment, but then phasing back to her usual bright cyan. She moves an arm from Artoria&#x27;s waist, keeping one arm wrapped around while her now free hand reached up to clasp her soft cheek... holding it as Camille kissed back more and more.

*Artoria starts to rouse slowly and still finds herself in Camille&#x27;s arms, looking at the pulsating gem on her chest as is glowed in synch with her breathing. She then looked up at the woman as she nuzzled her horns, the sensation being very much welcomed though she knew Camille would probably prefer it was her hair. Her magic had any benefits, but the horns weren&#x27;t one of them, at least at time like this. She shifted and bit and scooted up to be face to face with the elven cyborg. She stared at her for a moment, looking a bit uncertain, but the tingling from Rui&#x27;s kiss was still there. She...she wasn&#x27;t sure anyone had ever kissed her quite like that before...not since Durbin and even then...*

*She stops again, blinks a few times and then steadies herself before placing her lips against Camille&#x27;s in a soft, tender kiss.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Rui looks back at Chloe.

The gem at the centre of her bosom, now more bare due to the satin of her robes parting more and more overnight, glowing and dimming along with her steady breaths. Only in her sleep would the other three get to see her face stuck with such a calm look. No scowl. No cold stare. No firm jaw. Just purely relaxed with her arms wrapped around the waist of their newest companion.

She squeezed her eyes and slowly opened them, a savory smell entering her nose.

IT WAS REAL!?!? Artoria&#x27;s eyes widened as she looked down to find herself laying atop Rui, Camille&#x27;s arms around them both as the other two women slept soundly. The horned gnome was confused, uncertain, but then...looking at their faces...she just felt so warm. She closed her eyes and buried her face in Rui&#x27;s chest and leaned into Camille&#x27;s body, just feeling them both breathing. Feeling them both holding her. Feeling...loved.

The cyborg&#x27;s breath immediately catches when Artoria grazed over where her augmentations connected to flash.. a brief reminder of what she was, but she didn&#x27;t react negatively.*

*Camille allowed Artoria to guide her hand, though feeling a little more self conscious now that her roboticness was revealed completely to the Gnome.

She lifts her leg a bit over Rui&#x27;s and smiles as her chest pressed against the other girl&#x27;s back.* **&quot;We love you too Rui...&quot;** *She said softly while Artoria felt so much warmth. Her body was putting off a lot of heat now as well, breathing softly but deeply as she let the three women just envelope her in love. Love? Yeah, it was love. She wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of love yet, but she knew in her heart that it was love. She turned over, looked Rui in the eyes for a moment with something deeper than gratitude and gave her a kiss. It was a soft, warm, loving kiss that was full of affection. She then pulled away and looked toward the monk with a smile.* **&quot;Thank you Rui...I love you guys too.&quot;** *She then lingered there for a moment before flipping back over to Camille, looking the tell woman over for a moment before putting her arms around her...under her dress a bit to feel the skin of her hips and pressed her face against her chest, being careful to let her horns hurt the other woman. Her hands traced along the cyborg&#x27;s skin but also where flesh met with steel, and Artoria knew now why she felt a connection to the other woman. She reached over and took Camille&#x27;s hand and pulls it under her shirt, pressing it against one of her scars, then another, and another...before long she let the elven woman explore her body as she wished, looking up to her with understanding eyes. Eyes of someone who had endured hardship. Eyes of someone who knew what it was like to have their body damaged by things they never wanted to be part of. There were differences, of course, but Artoria wanted her to know...that maybe, even if only a little, that she understood.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">*Rui smiles as she begins to go and snuggle with the other women.

She would press up a little against Artoria, satin and occasionaly exposed skin under against the Gnome as her hand found its way on to her hip. Though her arms didn&#x27;t radiate much heat at all, her body certainly did.. and Camille simple felt warmer and warmer as she cuddled up to this new person she had just recently met.

She hands Camille her plate before taking a seat near Rui, taking a bite and just glowing.* **&quot;Oh my GOD this is good!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-06-13</p> <p class="message">*Rui smiles as she clicks her feet together as she flies up to the roof.

She was ready to get her plate and leave, heading up to the roof manually as she had no means of flight.

The cyborg holds on to Chloe a little before standing.. stumbling for a moment but managing to keep her footing. The new weight was definitely something she was going to need to get used to.. but at least she was a lot safer now, right?*

*Camille immediately pulls Chloe up and into a tight embrace, kissing the top of her head while keeping up the tight hug.* **&quot;Thank you Ms. Springfire.. this.. I love it..&quot;**

Maybe...I hope so. Just give me a few more minutes and we&#x27;ll know for sure. Also this room smells like heaven and you&#x27;re both angels.

*After the 10 minutes, Camille had continued to diligently assist Rui.. but paused upon hearing the loud ckatter of metal.

It won’t stop me...but I love you Camille.”** *As Rui jumps up a bit and kisses Camille on the lips.* **”We should probably get some food for when Chloe returns...I will start cooking.”** *As she let’s go of Camille and goes through some of the fridge.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-06-12</p> <p class="message">*Camille raises a perfectly shaped eyebrow as she watches Chloe dash off to the hallway and lord knows where.

I.. don&#x27;t feel comfortable referring to her with her first name still.&quot;**

The small booklet-turned-hitlist still kept away in a secret pocket of her tailcoat would reveal such. The need for retribution.. for vengeance to be enacted on all who supported the experiments she went through.. she would become the server of her own justice.. Alone, though.

There was magic in those blades, even if only a little, and the changes to her body were WAY too elaborate for Chloe to just start poking around with until she had a better understanding of them. But as she looked at those bladed legs she wondered what she could do to...wait...they weren&#x27;t blade. THEY WERE SWORDS!!!* **&quot;Oh...OH! OH that&#x27;s good!

Possibly some fine tuning will be a big help, I suppose. I have gotten.. somewhat comfortable.. but I do find myself having a hard time balancing occasionally.&quot;**

*She accepts the kiss from Camille.. appreciating any affection she could get especially after what she just said.

She hears her words, but that last bit causes the sadness to enter her eyes again, but only a little. She wraps her arms around her again and rests her head on Rui&#x27;s chest, just listening...quietly. Finally she speaks in a soft tone, not sure if she can say the words, but trying to anyway. She&#x27;s scared, and she wonder if this was what Rui felt the previous night in the tub when she spoke to Chloe. It must have been, and she understood why she felt the need to say it when she did.*

**&quot;Rui...I&#x27;m not sure if I can do it. If I&#x27;m strong enough. I might just be selfish, or jealous, or scared. Maybe it&#x27;s none of that. I&#x27;ve...I&#x27;ve never had anything like this before, and I don&#x27;t know what to do with these feelings in my heart. I just know they&#x27;re there, and it would be too painful to leave them at your door. I...I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m strong enough to share you, or if I would even get along with your other lovers. But...they just love you to, and you love them...like you love me. So...I don&#x27;t know if I can be what you need...or even what you want...&quot;**

The process takes a bit longer than with normal clothes, but it fits her perfectly. Like scary perfect. It was neither too loose or too tight. It wasn&#x27;t even heavy. Just...snug...and warm. Chloe helps Rui with the last bit, her hands lingering a bit longer on the other woman than she intends. All the same she steps away and looks at Rui, a smile crossing her face.* **&quot;You look beautiful...I mean you do even without the armor but...you&#x27;re just beautiful.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-06-08</p> <p class="message">*Rui looks at the piece of armor...and then at Chloe* **&quot;Chloe....this is beatufil.&quot;** *As she pulls the Aasmir head so that she can give a really good kiss on the lips* **&quot;Thank you so much for it!

It feels right having her there holding her, being close to one another. She pours those feelings into her creation, and soon a suit of armor takes form. It&#x27;s made from soft leather, a mix of blues and white, with studs like diamonds across the shoulders. There&#x27;s a hood attached to the collar and coat tails stretch down the back a bit. A kidney belt like portion helps to protect the wearer but also help with blood circulation, and the pants that go with it are sturdy but flexible as not to effect movement. Finally there are a pair of studded boots and gloves that, like rest of the outfit, look sturdy but flexible. In all honestly while it looked less like armor and more like a cute but stylish outfit, one perfectly sized for Rui. But the most noticeable thing of all was a heart shaped pattern in the center of the chest piece lined with strands of gold.* **&quot;Phew...that was...I&#x27;ve never made anything like this before...&quot;** *She looks back at Rui with a smile, hoping she liked it.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-06-08</p> <p class="message">*Rui feels the kisses and then she is like OH THAT IS WHAT SHE MEANT!

A little piece of tonight just to remember. Now hold me.

Usually she would concentrate on something specific, focusing on the shape and design of what she was trying to create. But this time...this time she was focused on Rui. On her smile. On her voice. On her warmth.

To be touching her shoulder. To have kissed her. But she had...she was right here. What had Chloe done that could even come close to that? All this magic she had...and how much of a difference had she really made in the world? She pondered that and then snuggled a bit closer to Rui, smiling but almost looking...sad.* **&quot;You are wonderful Rui...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-06-08</p> <p class="message">*Rui smiles as she stands up and goes walking to her drawer and picks up the photo that was placed down and moves next to Chloe.

But...her parents did that to her? That was...not okay. Not at all. Before long though they had gotten Chloe down to a fitted tunic and pants, the curves of her body having been only slightly exaggerated by her defensive wear. She stretched a bit, her shirt riding up just enough to show her toned belly, though her borderline F cup breasts caused it to hang oddly on her anyway.* **&quot;AH! That&#x27;s so much better. I practically live in that stuff but can&#x27;t wait to get it off sometimes.

Secondly: Chloe notices the scars but feels strangely about them. She is curious, of course, but she doesn&#x27;t feel bad for the girl, or even lament for her body being blemished.
