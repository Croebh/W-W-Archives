In times of crisis in the past, she had always been alone after all - well with Venixayla by her side. It felt reassuring to have someone else to rely on now.* **&quot;Better disoriented than dead.&quot;** *Arizys gave her pack and equipment one last look before nodding towards Aghayon.* **&quot;Ready to go.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon helped Ari as best he could. Not just to speed things up but to just be with her right now, to give her the feeling that, despite the shitty situation, that he was there with her.* **&quot;I don&#x27;t know but whoever we meet that is not of the Guild, consider them an enemy. Once we have enough supplies... We will teleport a lot... I hope you are ready for the disorientation...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-07-25</p> <p class="message">**&quot;No reason to dilly-dally then.&quot;** *She wipes herself off, hastily stowing away equipment and such she was just using for smithing, before reaching out for Venixayla and her armour; strapping the former to her back while quickly getting the latter worn.* **&quot;Any danger around here currently, or are we safe to make an escape right now?&quot;** *Arizys quickly asks while ensuring she had all her equipment at the ready. It seemed like a pretty big deal right now, after all, and if it was as dangerous as he made it sound, she wouldn&#x27;t be surprised that they&#x27;d need to make a quick escape plan.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Someone we don&#x27;t know yet but is not only strong enough to overpower Ethen but also who has appearently backing from the lords alliance , I have no idea what the what could be but it&#x27;s looking bad out there...

Grab your stuff, Venix and get ready to say this Place goodbye for a few days until we all can regroup in a safe location and make a plan how to get the guild back.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Under attack?&quot;** *Arizys raises her brow at first, clearly not expecting the air of tension around Aghayon when he leaned in to kiss her cheek. It cut through any form of embarrassment she could be harbouring now after all, and replaced it with a sense of worry she couldn&#x27;t understand yet.* **&quot;Who? What? Why?&quot;** *Rapid fire questions in her confusion.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message">**&quot;More like that I&#x27;m stressed the fuck out...&quot;** *He says after closing the door and walking over to Arizys and giving her a kiss on the cheek.* **&quot;You need to grab your stuff...

She was in the midst of just testing out some new crafting techniques in hopes that she would find it easier to coalesce more pieces of Venixayla to the base blade in the future. Whatever commotion that was outside was likely unheard within here with all the hammering and crackling of lightning.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon comes barging into Ari&#x27;s room, his back turned towards the whole room as he looks into the Hallway just to make sure he wasn&#x27;t followed.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>

Don&#x27;t wanna drop this..&quot;** *Arizys was doing her best to hider her barely concealed form behind the stack of bamboo baskets, but that could only do so much. She averts her gaze from Aghayon&#x27;s muscular frame too.. just focusing on putting the stack down on the little table beside the booze and taking off the lid. The steam immediately wafts out, and it definitely smelled heavenly.* **&quot;D-Don&#x27;t stare at me like that..&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn stammered out while looking at the space she had to enter. She was glad she had requested a relatively large space for the tub. She was just pushing her luck initially, but the guild seemed to have an infinite source of wealth so why not. With that, she brings an arm to her chest subconsciously, before slowly slipping into the tub while her face reddens more.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-13</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon smiles a little when Ari comes in and makes some space in the bathtub so she could climb in better while she was all flusterd by the situation. She put that kinda onto herself when she agreed but Aghayon didn&#x27;t want to pressure her into anything that was to uncomfortable for her. Though he agreed that she could have used a bigger towel for this because there wasn&#x27;t much that was hidden anymore and it got Aghayon a little excited that was for sure.* **&quot;I am watching.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle and closed his eyes at the heavenly smell of the dumplings.* **&quot;Hmm... That smells heavenly!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-13</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Yeah yeah..&quot;** *Arizys sighed in a flustered manner as he walked away.. her heart racing at the thought of the time to come. Focusing on her cooking only helped so much after all, and with a few hot minutes in the steamer, they would be ready. While waiting for that, and seeing that Aghayon had already entered the bathroom, she decided to get out of her own clothes too. Using a small towel, she wiped off any grime and dirt first too, and quickly cleaned it off with Prestidigitation before wrapping herself up in a towel too. Jeez.. she really needed to get a bigger one if they were going to do this more in the future. The towel was barely large enough to hide her features after all.* **&quot;Coming in.. watch it..&quot;** *She carries the warm bamboo baskets towards the bathroom and slowly opens the door.. a deep blush staining her cheeks as she peeked in.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-12</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon nods and leans over her shouoder to give her a soft kiss on her cheek.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t take to long!&quot;** *He says in a soft tone, indicating that he was just eager to get some nice relaxation in with Ari before he fills her glas with another Sip of wine to give her another one. Aghayon then grabs the bottle and the two glasses before walking over to the bathroom whre he got out of his shorts after placing down the bottle and glasses on the table and starting to scrub himself off from all the dust of travel and the battle. He couldn&#x27;t wait to soak himself in the tub and after he was cleaned off he wrapped a towel around his waist and lowers himself into the bathtub and lets out a satisfied and relaxed sigh.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-12</p> <p class="message">*Arizys was a tad worried, but drank down the sip anyways. It was.. good! Now this was certainly something her weak tolerance could handle. A smile spreads on her face immediately. Finally! A drink which wouldn&#x27;t get her shitfaced and blabbering nonsensically like an idiot.* **&quot;Yeah! Pretty good actually.&quot;** *This was definitely a drink she could use to build up her alcohol tolerance.* **&quot;You can get into the bath first. These still need to be steamed and I need to prep the sauce.&quot;** *She said while finishing up wrapping the last of the dumplings. They looked cute! Little green pockets with meat within.. and who knows what secrets were within this time?*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-11</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon places his glas down and lifts Ari&#x27;s to her lips so she could take a drink of that nice, light and fruity wine. There was even less alcohol in there then the last one they shared and it was realy nice overall.* **&quot;How is it?&quot;** *He asks before pulling the glas away again since he poured each of them just a single sip since the bottle needed to last the whole eveningafterall. He then went over to the bathroom to check on the bathtub but it could go a little more as he runs his hand through the warm water before he went to just bring in the living room table since it was a good bit lower then a normal table so it had the perfect hight for the bathtub.* **&quot;I am looking forward to this!&quot;** *He says after turning off the water and picking up his own glas to take his sip of wine and nods approvingly himself.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Mind checking on the bath to make sure it&#x27;s not overflowing? Maybe bring that low table in too so we can safely put the food and wine down.&quot;** *Aghayon would find her expertly wrapping dumpling after dumpling. Her eyes were focused, and her hands were swift - making plump dumplings one after the other with peak efficiency.* **&quot;Mind feeding it to me? Hands are a tad dirty.&quot;** *Arizys doesn&#x27;t realise she said something which would normally make her blush immediately after.. but she was too focused with her cooking!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Sure! What do you need me to do?&quot;** *Aghayon asks as he walks over to grab two wine glasses and unkorks the bottle, giving the kork a little sniff to see if the wine was still good before pouring the two a sip of the fragrant drink and holds the glas out to her.* **&quot;As light, fruity and sweet I could get it without being grape juice but still very tasty.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-10</p> <p class="message">(Oop sorry didn&#x27;t see the notif here)

**&quot;I&#x27;m preparing cabbage dumplings, and the bath is getting filled up right now. Mind setting up the rest?&quot;** *She called out behind while the scent of ginger and other aromatics waft into the air. Sight and smell were vastly important aspects to food, after all. Arizys found that one ate with their eyes and nose first when a dish was presented to them, and if those were not satisfied, no watering mouths could be expected.. and that was bad! With the need to impress she had, she wanted every dish she made to have people craving for more!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-10</p> <p class="message">***Plop*** *And Aghayon was back already. Not even 2 minutes had gone by when he left the room with his magic.* **&quot;And here I am again.&quot;** *He says,holding a bottle of a light red liquid in his hands as he smiles towards Ari and taking in a good deep breath of the first scents of cooking. Whenever Ari was cooking the room smelled heavenly and he was looking forward to that!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-09</p> <p class="message">*Arizys sighs, putting a hand over her chest to try and calm her pounding heart in any way possible.. well exaggeration, since she could have shocked her heart into rhythm, but let&#x27;s not get into the nitty-gritty. After a few moments of just sitting there being flustered, she sends a mage hand to her bath to get the hot water started, before she herself began to get some cabbage dumplings made. Arizys already had the ingredients after all, and began to slowly hum to herself while preparing some dumplings.. while the mage hand then returned to help set up the steamer too.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Don&#x27;t worry.&quot;** *He says softly and takes her hand for just a moment.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll pick something fruity and light. I don&#x27;t want to make you drunk.&quot;** *Aghayon softly squeezes her hand before he gets up and stretches himself, showing off the rolling muscles hiding beneath his scales before* ***plop*** *He was gone from the room, still only in his shorts.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh j-just go and get it already, you slow b-butt.&quot;** *Arizys pokes his abdomen a tad while blushing from the snoot kiss. GAH! Now this too! This hunk was gonna make her explode one day. Explode with emotions!* **&quot;Remember.. nothing too hard..&quot;** *She gently shifted off Aghayon so he could properly get up.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-09</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon just softly smiled. Making her speechless was more then worth any of this and her look was just icing on the cake. He leaned down and gave her a soft kiss on the snoot before he slowly sat up.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll think you need something to cool down. How about that wine hm?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-08</p> <p class="message">**&quot;AH-.. I..&quot;** *Arizys struggled to get a retort out. Well.. it wasn&#x27;t that she didn&#x27;t like it.. but it made her feel feelings! That goofball stare and his affectionate rubs. Making her feel feelings and emotions that make her go gooey inside! How dare he! The angel blue Dragonborn was outwardly just melting though, and if anatomically possible, steam would shoot out her ears as a mind scrambled look takes over her face.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-07</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon softly smiles at her. She was quick there was no denying that but not as quick as instant teleportation. Aghayon softly reached up and started softly rubbing and massaging her neck as he looked at her.* **&quot;Is a man in love not alowed to make his love heard to his beloved?&quot;** *He asks with a wink.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-06</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well I know you can be a slow butt, dummy hunk!&quot;** *Arizys blep-ed after the joking retort.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll still be able to zoom back faster than you can blink.&quot;** *Could she? Probably not, especially if Aghayon used high-scale teleportation to instantly get into and out of the guild bar. Doesn&#x27;t stop her from grinning cockily as if she could, though. That grin does evaporate when Aghayon continued with his romancing.. and was replaced by bashfulness again.* **&quot;Y-You and your s-sudden random a-affection and crap.. you a-absolute oaf..&quot;** *Despite that.. she agreed with everything he said.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-06</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh realy?&quot;** *He asks as he lifts a brow in a amused tone.* **&quot;You think I&#x27;ll need more then a minute or two to get us our wine?&quot;** *He asks a little bit suprised at her as he smiles.* **&quot;How about I just take you with me hm? I can do that too!&quot;** *He says with a soft chuckle before he leans back again before he lets out a sigh.* **&quot;You know... Being like this with you... It&#x27;s realy relaxing and comfortable. Just sharing some banter and warmth after a long trek with someone you love... Its what makes a relationship realy worth it.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That&#x27;s.. up to you dummy..&quot;** *Her breath was still caught in her throat after the kiss. Aghayon and his darn kisses! She still needed to get used to this whole romance stuff and not get so flustered every time he did anything remotely affectionate for her.* **&quot;Waiting on you to teleport away and get the wine.. I know I&#x27;ll be faster than you can be after all..&quot;** *Arizys cracked a small grin, though quickly hides her face after to obscure her flushed cheeks.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-05</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon let out a soft rumble as he nuzzles closer to her before he props himself a little up so he could kiss her softly before looking down at her.* **&quot;This is so nice.&quot;** *He says in a very soft tone while his tail squeezed hers in a soft and intimate way.* **&quot;How long do we want to lay like this?&quot;** *He asks softly while his head softly rests against hers just so he could keep his voice down because he enjoyed this closeness and silence between them a lot right now.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-04</p> <p class="message">*Arizys raised a scaly brow at first.. wondering what was on his mind as he pulled her closer into his chest. She found herself thinking about that quite often, she found; trying to decipher what hid in that mind of his. The angel blue Dragonborn may have called him a dummy hunk always, but some part in her knew he had things locked in her soul.. just like her. He had opened up more than she did, sure, but.. yeah. Arizys&#x27; tail tightened around his as she leaned in more, sighing silently with relief while cuddling more snugly without a word.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon just chuckles. If he would try something stupid then she would certainly leave him with something more then broken ribs. he lets out a soft, satisfied sigh as he just lay there with Arizys in his arm on the couch, enjoying the warmth and comfort of her room and presence and closing his eyes to just enjoy this nice moment to its fullest. he missed times like these and Ari could feel how he softly pulled her closer towards him without a word. Just wanting to have her close to him and cuddling.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-06-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Yeah, yeah.. sure, dummy hunk..&quot;** *She blushed a little, slightly ashamed of how poorly she handled alcohol. Arizys genuinely thought she&#x27;d have a better shot against booze since her tolerance against spice and similar extreme foods was good.. but alas, her mind was so simply hobbled by alcohol, and she sincerely hoped that she could eventually build a better tolerance to it the more she drank it.* **&quot;You better not try to pull something stupid.. or I&#x27;ll leave you with more than broken ribs.&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn blep-ed towards Aghayon, likely not meaning it but.. who knows!?*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-06-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Don&#x27;t worry Ari, I get the light fruity one.&quot;** *Aghayon says with a smile and gives her cheek a soft kiss on the cheek.* ***I&#x27;d never made you drunk on purpose.&quot;** *He says chuckling. As funny as it would be he had no intention to tank the poor lightweight that is Ari until she was just a giggly mess.* **&quot;Ooh a massage sounds lovely.

Are you *trying* to get me shit-faced again?&quot;** *Arizys chuckled while remaining cuddled in Aghayon&#x27;s embrace, tail tugging on his playfully.* **&quot;But I understand.. If you want, after the bath, I can give you a massage maybe? But don&#x27;t get the wrong idea or anything!&quot;** *She had to add that part..

Not from the fight no but from the long march home from the icy tundra Maretta had accidentaly send them to. He unbuckled his belt with his two swords at the door and puts them aside into the weapon holder near the door before he slowly pulled himself out of his coat. His shoulders felt stiff and e could tell some of those hits were pretty nasty even with his adamantine armor and Arizys healing. He let out a grunt as he unbuckled his plate armor parts, letting them clank onto the ground as he holds his side. The side of his chest felt kinda swollen and he could tell one of those bites had crushed his ribs on the right.

*The angel blue Dragonborn had gotten out of bed early that morning, excitement fuelling her since today was the day of her monthly meeting with a few contractors and questers she had made friends with before and during her stay in the Ashflower guild.

They had been roommates/cuddle buddies for quite a bit now.. and though his touch still brought blood rushing to her cheeks, it felt like a new norm now. A new norm with a steady relationship.. though.. was it a romantic one? They had never really officiated it.. but.. Arizys knew a deep part of her wanted it.*

After about a minute though, she&#x27;d finally slip out of it.. shaking her head a little before rubbing her eyes.* **&quot;Wha-?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon waited patiently till she came back to the door and opend it. He was still in his normal clothes from before but he carried some pajamas for now in his arm and a little bag with some soaps and his toothbrush.* **&quot;Well... I&#x27;m back now!&quot;** *He just says smiling before he steps in and closes the door.* **&quot;And seeing that you are ready for bed I should get ready as well!&quot;** *He says, walking over to the living room table.* **&quot;Unless you wanna watch me change you can go ahead and get comfortable.&quot;** *He says with a wink over his shoulder.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">*Arizys didn&#x27;t exactly hear that right.. but jumped when she heard Aghayon&#x27;s voice. Was that knocking? Thank the lords he knocked.. Otherwise she&#x27;d be caught in a not-so-favourable condition!* **&quot;Oh! Uh.. give.. give me like a minute! Or two.. or three..&quot;** *Arizys stumbled about, trying to properly put on the pajamas, but buttons were hard to use when your centre of balance was spinning. Eventually, she does wear it right, and opens the door with a mage hand woozily pushing it open as she slowly made her way back up.* **&quot;Done! I think.. Jeez.. you.. You sure were slow.. I told you to be faster..&quot;** *Ah yes.. spouting random excuses for no reason.. That.. that&#x27;d show Aghayon not to be slow!*

*Arizys could really use more alcohol tolerance.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">*The sound of footsteps quickly approached Ari&#x27;s door and shortly after, after some needed deep breaths, Aghayon opend the door again. Just to quickly turn away and close the door a bit more as he saw Ari just standing in front of the wardrobe.* **&quot;I&#x27;m back!&quot;** *He says audible, having the door between him and Ari while he looked outside the window, watching the snow gently falling from the sky. He had gotten a good glimpse though and what he had seen got his blood all hot... He had an Idea how Aari looked under her clothes and got a good feel before of her lean and athletic body but seeing it was something else. Though he had to contain himself... He didn&#x27;t want to ruin this!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">*Well.. the guild was rather large, and Aghayon being one of the older members likely had his room quite a distance from Arizys&#x27; since she was relatively new here. Her, being the impatient Dragonborn she was, sighed in boredom a little after 14 seconds passed, and she decided to change into pajamas too. After all, she was super fast, and there was no way Aghayon could come back quicker than she could finish dressing right? Well.. wrong. Very wrong. Arizys was drunk after all, and that made her sense of balance shaky at best. She had somehow safely made her way to the living area of her room, tossing her clothes aside before reaching the wardrobe clotheless. Arizys did manage to find the pajamas Aghayon bought her.. just as he was about to return to her room.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon gives her a kiss on the lips, just long enough to make it worth it.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll be like the wind! You just get comfortable and I&#x27;ll be right back!&quot;** *He says afterwards, softly caressing her cheek before he got up and jumped over the railing that seperated the sleeping Area from the rest of the room, down to the lower levels before she could hear him running over to the door.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll won&#x27;t make you wait long!&quot;** *He shouts up before she could hear the door opening and his footsteps leaving the area. Aghayon raced down the corridor to his room to quickly gather some toiletrys and a few of his most comfortable pajamas before he made his way back.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Huh? Oh.. okay..&quot;** *Her arms around Aghayon tighten a little more, and she sheepishly kisses his cheek in return after he kisses her, before pulling her hands back to herself to let him free. Arizys felt colder immediately, and a good portion of her mind wanted to cling back to him, but she somehow managed to stpp herself.* **&quot;You better run.. Don&#x27;t take too long..&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn said cutely despite her serious face, which was almost laughable due to it just being her puffing her cheeks.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon blinks as well as he hears her mumblings and it was time that he blushed just a little though his black scales didn&#x27;t show it but he could feel his face warming up. He clears his throat a little.* **&quot;Alright... Though I think I still get some pajamas over... We might warm eachother sure but I had some winters where I still cooled my back and I realy can life without that noise.&quot;** *He says with a smile. Though... He actualy just wanted to avoid an even more embarassing accident then the last time because without clothes... well... That could become a little bit more embarassing. Aghayon gave Ari another kiss on the cheek as he sat up slowly.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll be quick though... Don&#x27;t want to keep you uncuddled for to long.&quot;** *He says with a soft tone.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-11</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Sure..&quot;** *Arizys didn&#x27;t mind having a companion to sleep with. Her duvet could only warm her up so much after all, and Aghayon was a good person to have around. They shared a great dynamic, and they could challenge each other in more ways than she could think. And maybe.. just maybe.. she wanted him close more of the time so she could learn to develop her feelings for him in a manner more digestible for herself.* **&quot;Huh? I don&#x27;t really care.. Your scales are warmer I think.. and the duvet will cover us.. Just don&#x27;t do anything weird I guess.. Wai- huh?

She slowly calms again when their faces near, her breathing slowing slightly as her gaze stays on his. The angel blue Dragonborn pauses when he makes the offer, before nodding slightly.* **&quot;Stay with me tonight.. and tomorrow night.. or.. however many nights you want to.. You&#x27;re warm.. and winter nights are cold..&quot;** *Arizys was blurting out her barely coherent thoughts, her mind&#x27;s fallen barriers letting her true feelings about this intimate exchange of affection out.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-10</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon chuckles softly and rubs his cheek against hers with a smile.* **&quot;I shall blame myself if you admit that you are pretty cute as well.&quot;** *He says with a chukle before he pull his head back again and looks at her.* **&quot;Ari... It&#x27;s getting late and... I have a question... Do you want me to stay the night here?&quot;** *He asks. He wasn&#x27;t asking if he could stay no, he was asking if she wanted him here. He hadn&#x27;t intended to spend the night in her room. On the contrary, he had planned to sleep in his room after all this but... Now he kinda didn&#x27;t want to...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-09</p> <p class="message">*Arizys nuzzles Aghayon in return, reciprocating his affectionate hug more too while her tail continued to snuggle up against his.* **&quot;Blame yourself for making your dummy-ness so adorable..&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn muttered jokingly, sighing warmly before closing her eyes and trying to process her situation with her drunken mind. She knew not why she was enjoying Aghayon&#x27;s company so much.. but maybe it was because she hadn&#x27;t had affection for so long. Her experiences had made her build walls.. walls which were difficult to tear down by any means.. but Aghayon was somehow managing to do.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-08</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon softly chuckles and nuzzles his cheek against hers after those words.* **&quot;I know.&quot;** *He says softly and pulls the angel blue dragonborn close to himself.* **&quot;Thank you for letting me be such a dummywith you.&quot;** *He nearly whispers as he closes his eyes and just nuzzles into her some more. He was very happy at the moment and he could hardly put into words why that was the case. Was it because of being with a cute, hot and strong woman? Or because he could finaly get some good cuddling in after he and Zyrka said goodbye with eachother. It was hard to tell but in this moment, he was very happy and just content as he basked in her warmth and her lovely scent.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-08</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Dummy hunk..&quot;** *Two words which broke the serene silence between them after their kiss broke. Arizys.. well.. she didn&#x27;t really know what to think of it all. Her heart was beating wildly, her cheeks were scorching up, and she didn&#x27;t know why looking at this dummy himbo was making her breathe faster. She still held him though, not wanting this moment to end.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-08</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon takes in a deep breath after the kiss and smiled softly when their lips parted before he softly reaches up and places his palm on her cheek as he returns her gaze.

Arizys&#x27; tail continued snuggling up against Aghayon&#x27;s while she continued to embrace and kiss him.. melting into his warmth under her comfy duvet while holding on to him. In her drunken haze, his lips and security were an anchor to the real world.. and only after about a minute or so of her kissing him did she pull back half an inch. The angel blue Dragonborn drew haggard breaths, not realising they had been kissing that long.. and let herself drown in his masculine scent while staring into his eyes.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-08</p> <p class="message">*It was Aghayons turn to be suprised as Arizys just went and kissed him back but she would not hear him complaining. Instead, his tail gave hers another squeeze, his arms pulled her softly closer to him and he returned the kiss as soft and genuine as possible. She felt so soft and fragile in his arms even though she was much tougher then she looked. Aghayon sighed internaly, taking in her sweet scent, mixed with the fruity aroma of the wine as he just enjoyed the softness of her lips and the warmth that they shared.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-08</p> <p class="message">*Arizys wasn&#x27;t aware of what was happening at first. Just Aghayon leaning in, and her lips being warmed by his. God he smelled amazing.. and she didn&#x27;t know her face was feeling cold until his warmth had reached there too. This felt good.. what was this anyways? It was then she finally processed it. Arizys&#x27; eyes immediately widened when Aghayon pulled back, only realising she had been kissed then. It was indeed her first, but her drunken stupor didn&#x27;t make a big fuss out of it. Instead..* **&quot;That.. That was nice.. and warm.. and nice..&quot;** *And not a moment later, she dove into his lips in return, kissing Aghayon back as she continued to hold him as she did before. She didn&#x27;t know why.. but kissing him was cathartic, and she didn&#x27;t want to stop.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-07</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon looked at her a bit more after her words, seemingly hesitating but then his snout inched closer to hers, the breath softly brushing over her lips before he just took the dive and his lips connected with hers for just a fleeting moment as he kissed her softly. It might be the first kiss she had and Aghayon was pretty much aware of that but... He felt like that if they would continue to cuddle so much and even would go on to share the bed more just to be close to someone that he would go crazy if he wasn&#x27;t going just a little further. The feeling of her soft scaled lips lingerd on his for a moment before he just waited for the fallout of what he did.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well that&#x27;s your fault for being so slow, dummy hunk!&quot;** *Arizys giggled while continuing to stroke his back and pat the back of his head, enjoying the feeling of the broad expanse of his muscular back. Her cheeks remained reddened when she notices Aghayon staring at her so intently, her mind clouded by alcohol struggling to figure out what he was thinking in that dummy hunk head of his. She raised a scaly brow when he asked that though, pausing for a moment as his breath tickled her scaly lips. Arizys was trying to figure out what that meant.. but she likely wasn&#x27;t going to come up with anything conclusive, so she just nodded.. responding with her breath tickling his lips too.* **&quot;Sure..&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-06</p> <p class="message">**&quot;We could do that though last time we raced you realy made me chase you.&quot;** *He says with a warm smile on his face. It was obvious he held that memory very dear to him. Aghayon looked at her and her reddend cheeks, noticing again that Ari had very thin scales if the blush was so visible and... He kinds thought it was cute. Aghayon just looked at hr for a little before he averted his eyes slightly.* **&quot;Would you mind... If I would be a bit more of a dummy?&quot;** *He asks in a soft tone as he looks back at her, letting her feel his breath on her lips again.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-04</p> <p class="message">*Feeling his warm breath on her neck sent tingles along her spine.. tingles which caused her blush to redden, and for her to whimper a little. When Aghayon moved his head back a little, she realised she wasn&#x27;t exactly in proper clothes to sleep too. Arizys knew not if she cared enough to change though.. but if the black Dragonborn did leave to get into comfier clothes, she&#x27;d change to the pajamas he got her some time ago.* **&quot;Could race you maybe.. teach you how to avoid my lightning better!&quot;** *Arizys grinned cheekily, clearly teasing him on how he always almost got hit by her random outbursts of electrical charge when surprised by his presence.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-04</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon chuckles softly while he rests his head again against the crook of her neck and nuzzling into her chest just a little like she had held him before. He let out a soft sigh as he just listens to her speak and breath.* **&quot;I would like that.&quot;** *He says softly as he kept just softly rubbing her back. He realy enjoyed this cuddling session even  though sooner or later he wouod have to go back to his room because he had not clothes fitting for sleeping in with him.* **&quot;Would be nice to have someone to train with regularly.&quot;** *He says softly before he pulls his head back again before he looks at her and smiles ever so endearing at her while seeking her eyes with his own.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-04</p> <p class="message">*Feeling Aghayon&#x27;s large hand roam across her lithe backscales was a warm sensation she didn&#x27;t know she&#x27;d enjoyed.* **&quot;Yeah I can tell, dummy hunk.&quot;** *Arizys punched his shoulder lightly again, before getting back to hugging Aghayon as she did before: a hand stroking the back of his head, while another comfortably rested on his broad back.* **&quot;I train everyday to match Venixayla&#x27;s lightning.. and damn is his lightning fast.&quot;** *It was why she had a more athletic rather than bulky build, her body having adapted to days of long distance quick running which would normally tire others out.. but not her. She had the soul of lightning in her after all, and that carried her ever step.* **&quot;Maybe we should work out together..&quot;** *Arizys whispered that last part out, a passing thought in her mind which had managed to be voiced.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-02-03</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon chuckles softly, watching her rubbing his shoulder.* **&quot;Lots and lots of training...

A honest to the bone man.* **&quot;Also I could ask you the same! You are realy fit.

Her cheeks were super red now too, and eventually a bit of her sober side shows as she punches Aghayon&#x27;s shoulder a little harder than intended, though still not enough to hurt. Not a moment later though, she was stroking his shoulder, as her face slowly turned calm.* **&quot;Dummy..

She probably would never admit it but she was realy cute like that and Aghaaon realy needed to hold himself back to not just plant a kiss on her lips.* **&quot;Why not?&quot;** *He says softly, his head not moving an inch away from her. He didn&#x27;t do that for putting on pressure but to just keep her close. He didn&#x27;t want to stop this warm embrace anytime soon.* **&quot;I am just being honest.&quot;** *He says with a soft and endearing smile before he turns his head away just slightly. He was certainly flusterd as well a little because he realy became to like Ari...

Maybe a small part of her knew of her stubbornness when it came to admitting one&#x27;s true thoughts and feelings, hence why she blurted out that she wanted Aghayon to get more alcohol for her in the future. That part of her knew that with enough time spent together with her barriers down, she&#x27;d slowly open up to him while sober too, but for now, it remains a constant struggle to avoid her lightning bolts each time he enters her room. Her blush deepens when Aghayon says that, a silent gasp escaping her which mingled with his breath kissing her scaly lips.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t.. look at me like that while saying that kinda thing..

He also enjoyed this more irrational Arizys more just because this hugging was nice.* **&quot;Whatever you want Ari.&quot;** *He said in a hushed tone near her ear when she made her demands as his tail gave hers  a gentle but affectionate squeeze.* **&quot;As long as it makes you happy I&#x27;ll do what I can.&quot;** *He says in the same soft tone before he pullshis head back a little to look her in the eyes, their snouts not far away from eachother and his breath softly grazing her lips while his hand around her back started to suftly rub her between the shoulder blades.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-01</p> <p class="message">*Arizys stayed silent as their snouts grazed one another&#x27;s, her hand still idly stroking the back of Aghayon&#x27;s head affectionately while her eyes were half-open. It felt almost like a fever dream or fantasy all of a sudden. A cold white winter outside, of which frosty chill was kept away by a warm tender embrace shared with someone she held undeniable care for. She used a mage hand to bring the duvet covers up more to cover them more.. keeping the warmth between them trapped as her tail found his. Arizys lets him coil his around hers, her own tail making an effort to wrap around his too to share more heat.* **&quot;You.. Y-You better pay up for being dumb like this all the time.. I expect more alcohol.. and maybe more hugs.. okay, dummy hunk&quot;** *Her barriers really were melted away with alcohol in her system, huh?

He could not wish for a better yuletide present.* **&quot;And thank you for letting me dumb with you.&quot;** *He says with a very soft chuckle as he opens his eyes, taking in her wonderful scent before he looks up, rubbing his snojt against hers but not going for a kiss for now. Just a little movement of affection and content. His tail snaked around his side and over her legs, looking for her tail to slowly coild around it ti make this little cuddle session just a tiny bit more intimate.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-01-31</p><p class="message">*Arizys felt a moment of catharsis when Aghayon oh so innocently confesses his liking towards her. It was as if hearing someone say her thoughts made her able to properly grasp it and better accept it. She stayed silent as the black Dragonborn elaborated, and at the end of it, she lets his words sink into his mind for a little longer, before reaching up to flick his snout gently again.* **&quot;You&#x27;re a dummy, y&#x27;know that..&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn whispers while staring at Aghayon, before shifting in their embrace slightly. Arizys shifts and moves up, before getting into a more dominant position of the embrace.. and pulling his head into her chest. She may have screamed about lewdness or fainted from embarrassment were she not tipsy, but alcohol truly brought out a more brazen side of hers. This wasn&#x27;t meant to be sexual anyways. Not knowing how to properly communicate it in words, she let her actions do the talking, and began to stroke the back of Aghayon&#x27;s head while letting him nestle his face into her neck and chest so she was the one giving him warmth now.. so she could reciprocate the safety he gave her.. and whatever other hidden meaning her gestures held.*

Arizys felt warm all over now, her insides warm due to good food and alcohol, and outsides warm due to the warmth radiating off the muscular Dragonborn in front of her.* **&quot;Why?&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn suddenly blurted out after her mind properly processed that he had been looking forward to this exchange of affection. She herself was craving for this too, so a part of her possibly wanted to know his reason.. and if it matched up with her own, even if she didn&#x27;t want to admit it. Arizys was never good with handling her emotions after all, and she had strange ways of dealing with them. This was one of said ways.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-29</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon chuckled.* **&quot;Eh, I just like to have a wall in my back when lying down thats all.&quot;** *He says softly after he got flick on the nose. He had no ulterior motive in climbing over her if he was honest because they just wanted to cuddle a bit though... He liked the view somehow. The black scaled Dragonborn climbed off of her and let himself sink into her bed, scooting up to her and puts an arm around her waist area as he snuggled up to her.* **&quot;I was looking forward to this.&quot;** *He says softly once the two settled into a comfortable embrace as he rests his head against hers, taking in her scent mingled with the smell of the food and closes his eyes.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-01-29</p> <p class="message">**&quot;A couch?

Besides, where would I put one, dummy hunk?&quot;** *Arizys&#x27; mind was all over the place now, though a portion was concretely stuck on the warmth and scent of Aghayon from him holding her like this. When he puts her down on her bed, she intended to shift to the side to give him more, but when he climbs over her.. Arizys stops and raises a scaly brow. She wouldn&#x27;t know if Aghayon was trying to proposition her. After all, she had practically zero knowledge in the field. So.. she brought a hand up to flick his snout gently before giggling.* **&quot;What&#x27;re you doing, dummy hunk? I ain&#x27;t a bed, and you&#x27;re way too heavy for me to support.&quot;** *Arizys blepped.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-28</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon waverd a little when Ari&#x27;s magic made him float all of a sudden and pulls her a little closer to himself.* **&quot;I just wanted to know where to bring you but... this certainly works!&quot;** *He says as he held her closer to him o secure her more in his grip.

Her insides felt warm and mushy, and she couldn&#x27;t wipe the coy smirk off her face. Thunderous clouds escape Arizys&#x27; sides and begin to wreathe her carrier&#x27;s legs.. and he&#x27;d feel his balance go off for a moment. A second later, he&#x27;d suddenly be floating, and it was the angel blue Dragonborn&#x27;s magic. She slowly lifted him up while remaining in his arms, and they would soon gently float up to the little section where her bed was.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-27</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon hugs her a little closer to hmself as of her request and just carefully picks her up like a bride.

Aghayon kept their glasses of wine refilled an Arizys cooking kept ther bellys warm and full until Aghayon just put his chopsticks aside and closed his eyes while all snuggled up to Ari.* **&quot;Wanna...

Her breath smelled of fruits used to make the wine, and within this proximity, Aghayon could smell that mingled into her usual scent of snowy rain and wet grass. When she gets pulled into the sidehug, she hiccups softly as her cheeks reddened, but she doesn&#x27;t complain. The only sound she made was a little near-whispered gasp, before a sighed &#x27;dummy hunk&#x27;. The wave of warmth and cologne drew her in a little closer, and before her rationale could stop her, her head was resting on the himbo&#x27;s shoulder. She&#x27;d the continue to eat her noodles, though a little awkwardly due to her current position, but she made no effort to move out of his embrace.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-25</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon softly chuckles as he watches her gulping down on the wine and shakes his head. Sure the wine hadn&#x27;t much alcohol in it but with Ari being such a leightweight when it came to alcohol she probably gwould get very tipsy from the wine. Aghayon took another sip from his before he just scooted his chair a little closer to hers and just put an arm around her shoulder and gives her a little side hug.* **&quot;Glad you enjoy it!&quot;** *He says softly smiling, fighting down the urge to give her a kiss on the cheek. From this close though she could get a nice waff of his cologne he had put up for the occasion.

Arizys wasn&#x27;t thinking about anything bad currently.. instead all her mind could reminisce about now was the warmth she was enveloped in that first faithful night she spent with Aghayon. To hide her embarrassment from such memories though, she reaches out to get the bottle of wine, immediately bringing it to her lips and throwing her head back. She began to drink the wine in big gulps, letting the alcohol warm her throat up with intoxication. Only after she finishes half the bottle does she stop, sighing satisfactorily before putting the bottle back down. God she felt so much like jelly.. warm jelly.. comfy warm jelly.. dumpling and noodle time.* **&quot;Wine.. Wine&#x27;s good..&quot;** *Arizys picked up her chopsticks again before getting another dumpling and chomping it in one bite.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-24</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon chucles and shakes his head before he turns his attention back to the food, scooping up some more noodles. He had noticed how she got more flusterd and open up more and more wich he greatly enjoyed. He was also glad that she was looking forward to some good old cuddling and depending of how that went and how long he would stay he might ask if he could stay the night here. He wouldn&#x27;t mind spending the night not alone for a change. When she whisperd he visibly hesitated. He didn&#x27;t want to ruin the nice atmosphere they had going but maybe he could just... He picked up a dumpling and looked over to Ari with a* **&quot;Hmm?&quot;** *to not just dig for an answer. If Ari wanted to share something morethat was up to her and not to him.

Her cheek scales had ever so slightly gotten pinker, the blush only darkening as she drank more of her wine. It wasn&#x27;t enough to make her really drunk or anything of the sort yet, but she was on the track to getting tipsy and all warm and gooey inside.* **&quot;Oh enough of that dummy hunk.. I&#x27;m.. I&#x27;m looking forward to it too..&quot;** *Arizys widened her eyes a little when Aghayon admitted that, but her walls had lowered enough due to the alcohol and trust she had for him that she let that spill. She brought her legs up, knees to her chest as she hugged them and buried her face in them.* **&quot;I haven&#x27;t found anything that comfortably warm since..&quot;** *Her voice was barely a whisper, but still audible by Aghayon.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-23</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon just shrugs with a soft smile before takng a sip of the wine as well.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll be straight with you on that one.&quot;** *He says as he sets down the glas again, keeping his smile going though it became softer over what he was going to say.* **&quot;Ever since your little sleep over at my place I...** *Aghayon took a slightly deep breath.* **&quot;I was looking forward to hold you again...&quot;** *There was no hesitation in his voice but something else... so ething... longing.* **&quot;So yeah...

She brought the glass to her nose, sniffing the fruity fermented juices while swirling it before looking up at the black Dragonborn funnily.* **&quot;Am I doing it wrong?

It floated over to the cupboard, opening it, before reaching up to get the bottle of light fruity wine Aghayon had purchased for her some time ago. After putting it on the table, it got two more wine glasses and put it beside.* **&quot;I&#x27;ve heard you&#x27;ve got some bartending skills up your sleeve.

There was a moment of pure silence after Aghayon practically whispered that into her ear, broken only by the soft sizzling of aromatics and flat noodles in the wok while the soft rolling rumble of the boiling water in the steamer continued. The angel blue Dragonborn was stunned to say the least, left a little speechless by the sudden act of affection. Her mind drifted to their little kerfuffle when she slept over in his room, her cheeks reddening before she sighed.. then leaned back ever so slightly before stirring the wok&#x27;s contents a little more.* **&quot;Dummy hunk.. T.. T-Tighter.&quot;** *Arizys loved the warmth of the soft embrace.. and despite her stubborn attitude, couldn&#x27;t hide that she wanted a little more.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-09</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon smiled slightly but then he saw the slight melancholy on her face. That was a look he didn&#x27;t want to see so he walked over after setting up the table and just threw every caution out of the window and just pulled her into a hug when she wasn&#x27;t working the wok for a moment.* **&quot;I mean it Ari... I am glad to be able to just spend time with you.&quot;** *He said in a very soft voice, his head next to hers. He didn&#x27;t care if he was crossing a line right now or not but he felt like Ari could use this right now. Besides, they had spent a whole night cuddled up together so why would this be worse?*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-01-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh shut it..

Your presence is a.. a nice gift too.

He already missed Lissa but it was nice to finaly see her again and to see how much she had grown in those two years. He was very happy that she hadn&#x27;t changed a bit and still was his little angel. But now he had to do other things to do! He took a quick shower, put on some comfortabe clothes comprising of a warm turtleneck sweater and some comfy looking jogging pants and made his way through the hallways of the guildhall with a packed gift under his arm. He wonderd if Lightning would follow him again this time when he opend the door.

It struck a teary chord within her heart.. but she kept it to herself for now. Though Arizys sympathised with Aghayon, that didn&#x27;t mean her feelings were settled by any measure. Though the black Dragonborn may have come to terms with it all, Arizys still felt confused and a little hurt.* **&quot;I&#x27;ve been.. okay. Furnishing this room has helped take my mind of.. you know what.&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn lightly punched his shoulder before turning around.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-22</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon closed his eyes for a moment when Ari said she was sorry and put a hand on his shoulder before he smiled a little.* **&quot;It&#x27;s ok Ari...&quot;** *He said before he looks at her.* **&quot;We had a nice and heartfelt goodbye and the stars in the night sky will always remember me of her and the good times we had so... It could be way worse.&quot;** *He says with a slight chuckle before he looks down between of them. He takes a deep breath before he looks her in the eyes with his stupid smirk.* **&quot;But enough of that. I had enough time to sulk and get to terms with that... I&#x27;m here because of you so... How have you been Ari?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-22</p> <p class="message">*Arizys was rocking on the chair a little in her small &#x27;gotcha&#x27; moment, but a part of her felt bad as she watched Aghayon sadden. She finally stopped said rocking when he broke the news, realising she had struck what was likely a very sensitive chord within the black Dragonborn. Arizys crossed her arms and leaned back, biting the inside of her cheek more as Aghayon elaborated. When he was done.. she didn&#x27;t exactly know how to feel. Despite the flurry of emotions breaking into her mind now though, Arizys could at least focus on sympathising with losing someone.* **&quot;I&#x27;m.. so sorry.&quot;** *She wanted to say more.. but didn&#x27;t know what to say. To counter the silence, Arizys would get up from her chair.. walking up to Aghayon and reaching up to give his shoulder a comforting squeeze.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayons smile dipped a little and there was a shift in him from genuenly nice to melancholic. He was still wrestling a little with Zyrka&#x27;s ascendance and maybe this was part of why he was here... to deal eith that as well and finaly move on. He had sulked long on this despite their goodbyes were nice and he had spend several nights on the roof just to watch the stars.* **&quot;I would not have those balls if I were still with Zyrka...&quot;** *He said with a deep sigh, turning his eyes away to look outside of the window.* **&quot;Zyrka has reached a new state of being and... Well... She went to a place where I can&#x27;t follow her... I will miss her... greatly so but I won&#x27;t stand in the way of her goals and her dreams or be so selfish to just keep her for myself so we said goodbye to eachother.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Arizys bit the inside of her cheek when he brought up thr little fiasco at the lobby. Though she did bring his gaze up to meet his, the angel blue Dragonborn remained silent and motionless despite his cocky smile. That smile.. that damned smile.. A part of her wanted to laugh with him, and another part wanted to send a fist through his gut. Those mixed feelings settled with that last part though, but Arizys wasn&#x27;t so easy to swoon. She was no expert on love, but she didn&#x27;t know what she&#x27;d feel about not being the sole partner in a relationship. Arizys leaned on thr chair and raised an eyebrow, before saying plainly.* **&quot;You must have quite the balls to say something like that to another woman while you still have a lover.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon looked at her and let out a sigh after a moment of awkward silence.* **&quot;Not completely no... I came here to talk with you... About the thing in the lobby and all that...&quot;** *He said, looking at the ground a little before he suddendly cocked a smile and looked at her.* **&quot;I wanted to apologize that it was so awkward and... what it might have done between us.&quot;** *He says, putting his hands onto his hips befire he shook his head a little.* **&quot;And I came because... I wanted to see you again. To see how your holdin up and if you might need something.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Arizys nodded and smiled politely.. though it just ended up looking like an odd grimace. She wanted to make some witty retort.. make fun of the gloomy look in his eyes.. do something which would spark up the fun between them again, but Arizys felt a mix of hurt and awkwardness she didn&#x27;t know how to string into words.* **&quot;Yeah.. he&#x27;s sweet. Can be a little bastard sometimes.. but he&#x27;s shown he&#x27;s got a good heart.&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn looked down at the floor, rocking on the balls of her feet.. unsure of what to really say.* **&quot;Is.. that all you came to my room for, Aghayon?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon did so as she said and put down the bottle on the table.* **&quot;Yeah... I know... But this one shouldn&#x27;t get you hammerd... At least if you don&#x27;t drink the whole bottle in one go.&quot;** *He says, smiling as well. It was nice to see her smiling so much aftervthe last time they saw eachother were... she looked very gloomy.* **&quot;Oh... And this.&quot;** *He said as he pulled a neatly packed package from under his coat and places it next to the bottle before turning around to look at her again.* **&quot;Ethen does some great work if you just tell him what you want and where. I&#x27;m pretty sure he has a nack for interior decorating and just doesn&#x27;t tell anyone!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Arizys didn&#x27;t think about the hole in the door frame. She could easily fix that up later.. maybe not easily. The angel blue Dragonborn went through a lot of trial and failure when furnishing the whole room, but she was pleased with the result anyways.* **&quot;Alcohol? I don&#x27;t remember that ending up great last time.&quot;** *She chuckled a little and gestured to the large table with notes and pencils sprawled about messily.* **&quot;I appreciate it though. Just put it over there.&quot;** *Arizys, catching herself smiling like a buffoon, covers her mouth and glances away.. coughing before turning to get a towel hanging over the chair.* **&quot;Yeah.. thanks.. I designed it myself. The guild&#x27;s surprisingly generous so it all came off pretty cheap.&quot;** *She&#x27;d remain silent after.. taking up her bottle and taking big gulps.. wanting to do something other than just stare at him in awkward silence.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon nods and walks in, using his tail to close the door behind him thought the hole in the frame was a tiny bit of a problem.* **&quot;Yeah, got you a bottle of some light but fruity wine.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle as he holds out the bottle gift bag and looks around to get a good look of her room.* **&quot;Gonna say! Like your stile Ari! Looks both comfy and practical.&quot;** *He says as he smiles at her. He noticed her stopping with the nickname she had given him and... he could understand why but that was part of why he was here. To smooth out things between them so to speak.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Arizys chuckled and rolled her eyes, shaking her head as she sheathed Venixayla and stretched out a bit.* **&quot;I&#x27;ve still never hit you with it dummy hu-..&quot;** *She stopped herself mid-stretch, gulping as her eyes narrowed. Maybe not right to call him that now.* **&quot;Whatever.. You said something about a housewarming gift?&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn unstrapped her blade&#x27;s scabbard from her back, slotting it in the weapons&#x27; rack by the training dummies before twisting her back lightly to stretch it in that direction too.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon jumped to the side and rose an arm to protect himself from some inevtable shrapnel from the doorframe as Ari suddendly blasted a lightning bolt at him.* **&quot;JEEZ! WATCH OUT WITH THAT THING!&quot;** *He yelled out, looking at her with a little bit of shock in his eyes before he catched himself and smiled a little at her.* **&quot;I hope that doesn&#x27;t become a thing! Blasting me with Lightning whenever we see eachother I mean!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">(__not__ aimed at Aggy!)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*The moment Arizys heard Aghayon&#x27;s voice, she yelled in surprise. The angel blue Dragonborn spun to face him, and in the heat of her emotions basically spilling forth into her mind swirling with magic-fuelled adrenaline, blasted a lightning bolt towards his direction again. Venixayla, thankfully, controlled the arc of lightning suddenly summoned from it.. sending it to hit the space above the doorframe rather than zap Aghayon.* **&quot;You.&quot;** *Arizys panted out as she settled her nerves.. though it was tough. Her heart was pounding, from the workout or him though she knew not.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon took a deep breath and opend the door before just leaning into the doorframe, watching Ari giving those dummys a good slicing wich made him smile.* **&quot;Heya Ari, wanted to see how you settled in... How are you doing?&quot;** *He asked before lifting a little bag up.* **&quot;Got you a housewarming gift.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon would hear grunts and the creaking of wood through the door, all of which paused when he knocked. Arizys, not knowing who it was, but not exactly caring, simply called out.* **&quot;Come in! Door&#x27;s unlocked.&quot;** *She&#x27;d ready Venixayla before whoever was out there opened her though, resuming her practice against the self-mending dummies she got installed in her room. Arizys would spring forth the next split second, slashing at the training dummies with lightning fast swipes one after another.. tearing through the structure of the equipment which quickly repaired after only to be shredded through again.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon had done some self distancing himself, needing some time to get his own feelings in order but with the ascention of Zyrka and a very heartfelt goodbye, he was ready to meet up with Ari again. He made his way up to the new wing of rooms and looks for the door of Arizys room. And afer finding it, he walked up, put a smile on his handsome mug and knocks on her door.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message">*Arizys, with a cloudy mind, had been working for days on uplifting the rather large room she was gifted on the new wing of bedrooms built to compensate for the higher and higher amount of members joining the Ashflower guild. She&#x27;d worked with Ethen to get most of the furniture done, getting his help for sourcing materials but doing most of the handiwork herself after. Finally, after some time from that hellishly awkward lunch they had, and some self-distancing from Aghayon, Arizys&#x27; mind was relatively clear. After all, she had been focusing on working and furnishing most days.. too busy to think about her conflicted feelings and emotions she had barely stuffed down.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-12-21</p><p class="message">(Art by Siu Fung Kong - Less spellbooks, wizard robes hanging about, and magical portals)</p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/790598274021195796/790600678845710346/uploads1543389475800-VisualCommunications02Week04KongSiuFung06.png"/></li>
