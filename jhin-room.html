A fleeting mage hand reveals how such a thing was possible. Jhin was seated by the piano, the massive instrument beside the little bed under the ajar window Wonder was sleeping on. The half-elf didn&#x27;t turn back though, instead focused on playing the soft melody. The cherry blossom petals which floated around him were accented beautifully by the grandiose moon visible out the window, the curtains billowing a little as the breeze got in, but not wildly enough to wake Wonder.*

And playing around with the cane again.  They read each page and begin to tap along to the entire beat* **Tap Tap Tap** *Like a rhythm playing off on the bed.  They look at Jhin.

He was rather minimalistic when it came to clothes. After all, he only cared about one set of clothes.. the one he carried out every grand performance with. That didn&#x27;t mean he wasn&#x27;t ready to look good though. Jhin took out a simple white dress shirt with golden accents, whirling around the bottom half of the top with intricate patterns. The virtuoso then retrieved a pair of black slacks and headed to the bathroom to change into the new apparel.*

*He soon exited, his choices of clothing fit perfectly for his body type. Jhin&#x27;s sleeves were neatly rolled up to his shoulders, the fine fabric clung to his lean-muscular body perfectly.. almost as if the shirt was tailored specifically for him. Maybe he wasn&#x27;t so minimalistic.. looking good was important after all. Jhin glances to his mask and shakes his head.. instead just focusing on tidying his hair a little. No one knew of his background here anyways. He would then look to Wonder to see what they were up to after the time he spent dressing up.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message">*Wonder nods.

His foot taps rhythmically on the wooden floor as his mind drifts to the topic of romance. Jhin knew love was a raw expression.. an emotion he had utilised in a good portion of his artpieces.. but they were at most love directed at his art, not at someone else he deemed court-worthy. Hell.. he hadn&#x27;t considered anyone truly attractive beyond physicality before Maretta. Jhin knew of her capabilities.. even if it wasn&#x27;t all of it, he knew she was **very** strong.*

*Maybe that was what he was interested in.. strong, capable people who had something to offer to this world. Jhin could clearly see that Maretta was far from a stereotypical succubus, able to use her magics for much more. He thinks to himself a little longer before getting up and approaching Wonder, pointing at two labels poking out of the stack of sheets.* **&quot;Figure out how to play these two. They were my early works and still relatively simple.&quot;** *He snaps his fingers.. and illusory letters seem to pop up on the piano&#x27;s keys.* **&quot;I think I may take your suggestion to heart.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message">*Wonder nods* **”Then ask?”** *as they keep on reading all these notes.  Every page being taken careful consideration.  Their eyes keep on looking from page to page.

I will stay here and read.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Romance is a complex thing, Wonder. Though I do not mind courting her.. expressing affection in more ways than your innocent mind knows.. I cannot help but detect that Maretta may not want to be tied to someone.&quot;** *Jhin leans back a little, checking his perfectly maintained nails.* **&quot;The wonderful lady&#x27;s a succubus. She&#x27;s very different than the usual ones though.. able to keep it in check most of the time.. But I&#x27;m unsure if she would like to enter a relationship to say the least.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message">*They nod* **”Then why don’t you go ask her?”** *Tiliting their head.* **”Like how Hellfire asked me if I liked them.

It was relatively neat despite the several labels sticking out of it.. likely to name each set of sheets.

Jhin pauses for a moment when he hears Wonder&#x27;s request.. unsure of how to help.* **&quot;There.. are a few ways one may attain affinity with magic.

It made them feel like they are the only Tabaxi in the world with such an amazing mentor* **”Woooooooooo.”** *They watch the pedals float in the air*

**”Can you teach me how to use magic?”** *They just keep looking at the pedals.  A smile just permanently stuck on their face.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-15</p> <p class="message">*The virtuoso watches Wonder draw the lotus with water and dirt, staying wordless as he retrieved Whisper from his back. He aimed the firearm at his hand and held the trigger.. a slow blast of radiant light engulfing it to heal his wounds and clean up the dripping blood. Jhin was far from disappointed that the Tabaxi decided to use a medium other than blood. This was a sign of originality.. of possible creativity yet to bud.. and it needed to be harnessed carefully.*

*Jhin smiled a little as Wonder did a lil jazz hands.. nodding a little while combing his mousy hair with his now clean fingers. He put Whisper down and put a hand forth.. palm open.. facing the water and dirt. Slowly.. the dirt and water began to rise.. forming together.. almost weaving like fine thread.. to form the illusion of a real lotus.. though clearly more mystical with soft radiant light gleaming from its intricate petals.* **&quot;Indeed, Wonder. Magic is always a good touch.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-15</p> <p class="message">*Wonder looks at the bloody dagger.  As they begin to go wipe it clean.  Turning away from Jhin and cleaning the blade fully.  Before walking back and having water on the blade.  Begins to drip it in the shape of a lotus on the floor* **”Gotcha....”** *they begin to try and follow.* **”Hmmm.”** *looking around the room for some other things as well.  Grabbing some dirt and placing it in the water lotus.  It’s rather small to keep up with the room size but it gets the job done.* **”There we go.  Magic?”** *they jazz hands.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-15</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That art.. is much more complex than you&#x27;ve ever known.&quot;** *Jhin pats the Tabaxi&#x27;s back before letting them go. He walks over to the piano and picks up the dagger they left on it earlier, then returns and places the small weapon in the feline&#x27;s hand.. helping them hold it properly.. not as a weapon.. but as a &#x27;paintbrush&#x27;.*

*Guiding the dagger in Wonder&#x27;s hand, Jhin uses the tip of the steel blade to prick the skin on the back of his hand.. then slowly began drawing a lotus.. each petal as intricate as the last.. a flower birthed from blade and blood.* **&quot;The most wonderful methods of creating art may not be the most conventional. A longsword or firearm may fit a certain occasion.. a target may be fit for a canvas.. but the medium is as flexible as your creativity. From paints to flowers, to magic and blood.. *everything* can be turned into art.&quot;** *He finishes drawing the lotus on the back of his hand.. the dagger in Wonder&#x27;s hand now dripping with blood.. but Jhin didn&#x27;t falter nor show pain at all. He simply stared at the Tabaxi.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-15</p> <p class="message">*Wonder looks like your normal Tabaxi.  Very cute and cuddly.  But at the same time.  Those eyes were big disces...that you can see inside one soul.  But Wonder is just a small little sad tabaxi right now*

**&quot;I promise!  I will learn every single thing you have to teach me.&quot;** *as they smile the tears going away.* **&quot;Okay...what else do you have to teach me?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-15</p> <p class="message">*Jhin lets Wonder cry.. tears represented a pure emotion after all. The source of such tears was yet another piece of the mundane world which could be tuned into a fine artpiece. Pain and torture seemed to be a common birther to great artists.*

**&quot;Do not thank me now, child. I will be stricter as days go by.. as strict as needed to ensure your talent grows well. I pray you won&#x27;t disappoint me?&quot;** *Jhin releases the Tabaxi a little and tilts his head. He studied Wonder&#x27;s features closely.. being able to do so much more effectively now that he wasn&#x27;t wearing his mask.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-15</p> <p class="message">*Wonder looks so tired...but as soon as you call them an apprentice they cry.* **&quot;I...I am....thank you...I thought...&quot;** *as the Tabaxi just begins to cry a lot.  The tears hit the ground as they hold Jhin very tightly* **&quot;Thank you Mr. Jhin!&quot;** *Wonder just holds on as tight as possible.  But is so happy.  Grateful.  They let go of the longsword as it hits the ground with a* **THUMP** *it begins to change back to a cane*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*The virtuoso watches intently as the Tabaxi slashes at the illusory dummy. With each swipe, Jhin created more effects from the dummy.. a scar leaking divine light.. broken straw replaced by cherry blossom petals fluttering away. He smiled as Wonder ended on a fourth strike.. four was pure.. four was true.. four was art.*

*This was simply imitation though. Jhin was certainly flattered and impressed that their style had turned out so similar to his.. but originality was a core part of an artist. Sooner or later, creativity would need to be nourished within the young feline.. but for now, gratification.. much deserved gratification.* 

**&quot;You never need to worry about that, Wonder.&quot;** *Jhin slowly unclasps and removes his mask, placing the intricately designed accessory on the closed fall of the grand piano before walking towards the Tabaxi. He kneels and hugs them.* **&quot;I know potential when I see it.. and you&#x27;re overflowing with it. Look at me, child..&quot;** *Jhin&#x27;s eyes were swirling with honey and blood.. staring at them with wonder.* **&quot;You will never be treated wrongly by me.. Hold me accountable if I do. I only want one thing for you.. to make it so you can harness your full potential.. for you to become another artist of purity that will brighten this tawdry land with true art.. for you to become my apprentice now, and a wonder of times to come.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*Wonder takes a seat as they begin to watch in full view.  Taking notice of every little slash, technique, and everything.  As Wonder just begins to clap for a bit.  Before brushing themselves off and taking bringing out the longsword*

*They go to town.  Trying to copy Jhin&#x27;s move it takes them only 2 tries to fully understand what Jhin&#x27;s is showing them.  Jhin can easily tell this one picks up everything very quickly by just seeing it.  One slash...two...three.  On about the fourth Slash Wonder&#x27;s body can&#x27;t handle much more.  As they begin to breath heavily...but the glint in their eye says otherwise* **&quot;I can...keep going.  Please don&#x27;t throw me...away.&quot;** *Wonder lift up their longsword and keep swinging...but again after the fourth swing they can&#x27;t push further*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*Jhin watches for a while.. taking note of each accurate slash of steel. The virtuoso was certainly impressed that someone so young could wield a weapon this well.. but he was not here to mentor the use of weapons. He was here to teach Wonder how to make art. Jhin raises a finger as if to get them to pause and shakes his head.* **&quot;Halt, Wonder. As precise as your strikes may be.. as accurate each swipe you make is..&quot;** 

*He stands and walks up beside the dummy, so he could watch more closely.* **&quot;You lack flair. You are simply striking an illusion. Nothing more.. nothing less.&quot;** *Jhin retrieves his own rapier and takes a deep breath, flourishing with the needle-like blade and attacking swiftly.. his technique almost similar to the hand movements of a painter.* **&quot;You must act with grace! You must act with elegance! You must think of your tool not as a weapon, but as an instrument of art!&quot;** *Jhin makes one more stab before swiftly turning to Wonder, eyes gleaming a malevolent scarlet.* **&quot;I shan&#x27;t determine your style of art for you.. Such is a journey you must go through organically. What I can do though.. is lend you a hand at least. Now.. again!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*Wonder gives a nod as he holds the cane like a sword* **”Spada!”** *With firm tell the cane changes into a metal longsword as Wonder begins to swipe with precision and accuracy at the dummy.  They seem to handle the sword very well.  Taking short breaths right before taking a swipe.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*The virtuoso thinks for a moment before snapping his fingers. A swirl of darkness seems to grow at the centre of the room.. forming into a figure.. no.. a training dummy.. or at least the illusion of one. Jhin stares at Wonder for a moment before gesturing to the dummy.* **&quot;I suppose we may begin with foundational lessons first.. Do you know the magic word, or shall I help you find it?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*Wonder nuzzles a bit more before letting go.  They begin to stroll back to the bed and pick up the cane* **”No.  The old man that came gave it to me.  Said it can turn into a very powerful weapon if I say the magic word.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*Jhin visibly freezes for a moment when the Tabaxi hugs his leg. He was used to sexual forms of affection.. even romantic affection on occasion.. but this.. this form of affection.. like a pure bond between father and child he never had.. it irked him in an odd way. He pushed the thought aside though, simply patting Wonder and slowly trying to get away to the piano.* **&quot;You&#x27;re.. welcome, Wonder. Say..&quot;** *The virtuoso takes a seat and observes them for a moment.* **&quot;Have you trained to use your cane at all before?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*Wonder nods moving towards the bed and dropping a small bag down on top of it.  Opening the bag up is another set of clothes as well as what looks like to be a small candle.  Placing over to the left side of the bed and smiling.* **&quot;Thank you Mr. Jhin!&quot;** *Turning around and walking over to hug the Virtusos&#x27;s leg*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*The half-elf&#x27;s eyes narrow a little as Wonder simply played a few notes.. but said nothing of it. He cared much less about the Tabaxi playing with everything else.. and smiled when he saw that they still carried the dagger he gave him.* **&quot;The small bed by the window. I&#x27;ll figure out something else for myself.&quot;** *Jhin stated dryly while pointing at the bed. It was rather small.. barely enough for the half-elf himself hence why he rarely ever slept on it. It was likely large enough for Wonder to be comfortable though.. and for some reason, a growing part of Jhin cared about that.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*Wonder eyes glow as they see the room* **”Woooooooo.”** *They begin to walk around the room and explore every little bit.  Going by the piano and playing a few notes.  Moving around the room touching and playing with every little thing.  Finally they are happy and begin to put the dagger on top of the Piano and walk around some more.* **”Where do I sleep?”** *The Tabaxi looks up at the virtuoso very confused.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">*The masked virtuoso slowly brings the young Tabaxi to his room, closing the door behind him after Wonder had entered.* **&quot;Make yourself comfortable. It&#x27;s not too big of a space.. but it&#x27;s certainly sufficient enough.&quot;** *Jhin pats Wonder a little before heading off to the main room where he kept countless rows of books on art and music. He stood before an empty space and retrieved Whisper from its holster at his back.*

*He breathes in for a moment before aiming in front of him.. then holding down the trigger. No bolt of darkness was shot.. but rather the same darkness which ate at the custom piano earlier was released again. Instead of engulfing anything though, it formed into the shape of the piano it had absorbed earlier.. only for the shadows to slink away to reveal the piano perfectly as it was again. Jhin smiled behind his mask.. a final part to this room he called his. The half-elf then glanced to Wonder to check up on what the young feline may have gotten up to within the few minutes it took for him to summon the piano.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">(Art by Jason Chan)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718465841582047252/732611547201011712/jason-chan-ss19-jhin-props-final.png"/></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p> <p class="message">(Art by Theo Aretos)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718465841582047252/732611477911109814/theo-aretos-theo-aretos-kitchen.png"/></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-14</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/718465841582047252/732611462924599316/theo-aretos-theo-aretos-bedroomfinal.png"/></li>
