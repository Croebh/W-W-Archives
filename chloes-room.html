This was a pretty cute room ne coukdn&#x27;t lie about that and smiled a little before he looked for a place to sit and then just sat down on one of the little staicases before looking at Chloe and Rui.* **&quot;So... Camille... Still acting weird?&quot;** *He asks in a concerned tone.* (Btw, this happening after/before the quest or?)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Chloe looked surprised to hear Elfrida had let everything out to him, but also felt relieved. She was happy her little sis had found someone to confide in...though she wished it could have been her who was that someone. She understood why it wasn&#x27;t though considering she was at least partly the catalyst for all this. Maybe more than she realized. She hugged her friend and girl friend, trying not to worry about Camille or Elfrida, but finding it hard not to, or worry about Rui for that matter.* **&quot;Come on in Aggy. I think we&#x27;re going to round table this...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon puts on a soft smile before wrapping his arms around both of them.* **&quot;As many as I can give...

It&#x27;s about Camille...&quot;** *as she began to hop off Chloe&#x27;s bed and tie her hair back in a bun* **&quot;I also need a hug...&quot;** *as she walked over to the two and gave them a huge hug*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Yeah...

I think she&#x27;s carrying around a lot of guilt and confusion about what she should be doing. Honestly I feel it a bit myself. The lawful part of me keeps saying she should turn herself in to the authorities and make right the wrongs she&#x27;s committed...but the big sister in me wants to keep her safe and hopes Maretta can help. I&#x27;m...I&#x27;m just...&quot;** *Chloe heard the knock and closed her eyes for a moment, giving Rui another kiss before slowly getting up to go answer. When she sees Aghayon she forces a s mile past her worries and invites him in.* **&quot;Hey Aggy. Thanks for coming.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon, still in his red flanele pajamas, made his way over to Chloes room after leaving his own room to Elfrida. He hope she could get some good sleep in as he raised his hand and knocked at the door.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*She gave a nod as she began to listen to Chloe&#x27;s word.  She knew Camille was in there somewhere.  Somewhere...and she will just have to prove that she can get her Peaches back.* **&quot;Yeah...yeah...&quot;** *as she began to snuggle with Chloe in the bed* **&quot;So how is your sister?  How is she taking the whole guild thing?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Chloe nuzzled Rui and took her hand, holding it in her own while trying to comfort her. She really wasn&#x27;t sure what to say that might help, but she knew what she was feeling and hoped that would be enough.* **&quot;Then we get her back. We just keeping going after her, keep trying to make her remember us. I refuse to believe it&#x27;s all gone, everything we&#x27;ve been through together. Everything we&#x27;ve felt. We just have to keep fighting for it, and barring that...&quot;** *She pressed her forehead against Rui&#x27;s and speaks with a confident tone.* **&quot;She fell for you once Starlight. I&#x27;m sure you can reach her again.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*She gave a nod as she kissed Chloe again before resting her head on her shoulder* **”I just want her back...I want my peaches back.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Chloe looks a little mournful, but pulls Rui into bed with her and snuggles up against her, letting the warmth of their bodies intermingle as they talk.* **&quot;I know...we...all we can is our best for her.

I want to talk to him!”** *As she got kissed and Rui began to walk with Chloe in her arms to bed...placing the Cleirc down and smiling* **”Now then....We should talk about Camille.”** *Chloe can see it in Rui’s eyes...regret.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Chloe was startled by this, having not expected to be swept off her feet, but feeling something only Rui ever made her feel: like a princess. She returned the kiss, putting her arms around her lover&#x27;s neck and just enjoying the moment. Elfrida watched this and blushed, letting out a frustrated sigh before grabbing her hoodie and heading for the door.* **&quot;Alright, alright! I&#x27;ll go plot a heist or pester Dragosimp for a while. You two...have fun being a couple or whatever...&quot;** *She said this not with anger or spite, but rather embarrassment...and maybe a tinge of envy?* **&quot;IT&#x27;S NOT ENVY!!!&quot;** *She yells this at seemingly no one while blushing, slamming the door shut and leaving the two women alone. Chloe blinked, then looked at Rui before laughing. She then pulled the monk into a long...passionate...hard kiss...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Rui just gave a nod...and then did something different* **&quot;Hmm...&quot;** *as she swept the Aasmir off her feet.  Rui had known that Chloe would let her come closer...so she positoned herself just right to pull Chloe in and then lift her up like the Princess she is* **&quot;Well then.  That is very good news Queen Angel.&quot;** *She gave a soft chuckle as she kissed Chloe deeply.  Not caring what Elfrida has to say...but glad to be finally home*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Chloe smiles and holds Rui tight, letting the monk melt into her. She had missed this. She had missed this A LOT! She kissed Rui&#x27;s forehead and snuggled tighter against her...only to remember Elfrida was still in the room. She looked back at her sister who stared at the two with half open eyes before turning back to her puzzle, not seeming to care. Well...she was resisting the temptation to tell the two that they should get a room, but then she might get kicked out of said room sooner so...* **&quot;They really do need to get you guys some more help. I would volunteer, but Ethen is still getting used to his new arm and needs me around to keep pace with orders. I was thinking things would slow down after the...after the war...but it feels like we&#x27;re producing more armor and weapons than ever!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Rui gave a huge bright smile as she just collapsed into Chloe’s arms* **”Just...hold me tight for a second...Been working to much need a break.”** *As she was dressed down back to her usually tank top and shorts.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-03</p> <p class="message">*Chloe smiles upon hearing Rui&#x27;s voice and walks over to open the door, greeting her girlfriend with a big smile.* **&quot;Starlight! They finally gave you some time off!?&quot;** *Chloe was wearing a t-shirt and sleeping pants, looking quite comfy, but also wasn&#x27;t alone as Elfrida lay on the bed messing with a puzzle cube, garbed in a tank top and shorts. The younger Springfire glanced over at Rui before going back to what she was doing...which didn&#x27;t seem to be much at the moment...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-10-02</p> <p class="message">**Bang Bang Bang** **&quot;Angel!

Crap, she was going to be late. Shouldn&#x27;t have made out with Camille for so long. She throws on the last of her clothes and runs to the door, opening it to see a tall dark figure standing there. She is surprised for an instant...but then her eyes widen as she drops the tools in her hands and just speaks with a half gasp.* **&quot;You! You&#x27;re...you&#x27;re here!&quot;** *The figure steps in, giving her a nod.* **&quot;Chloe...it&#x27;s been some time. I suppose I never gave you my name back then, did I?&quot;** *He smiles softly, but the sadness is clear on his face as he finally tell her who he is.* **&quot;Darius Black. I&#x27;m happy to see you well...&quot;** *Chloe is...floored. She looks around, almost as if looking to see if anyway else is nearby so they would believe her, or just to ask them what she should say or do. Instead she just sort of fumbles with the words. Who wouldn&#x27;t?* **&quot;I...I haven&#x27;t seen you since the night I got stabbed! You...you saved my life! You told to come here and...and it&#x27;s been nothing but wonderful!&quot;** *She smiles and just seems excited but then slowly frowns.* **&quot;But I still haven&#x27;t found Elfrida...and ever since that night I&#x27;ve been able to...to do things! Use magic! I don&#x27;t...I don&#x27;t understand-&quot;** *Darius raises his hand and nods before speaking with a calm, respectful tone.* **&quot;You&#x27;ll see her soon. That&#x27;s what I wanted to tell you, but also to warn you that...it won&#x27;t be easy. But you can do it. You can reach her. You&#x27;re the only one who can. As for you magic...well...that was in you already. I just woke it up. Where it comes from though...well...suffice to say the All-Hammer has sired his fair share of children over the years.&quot;** *Chloe hears this but doesn&#x27;t understand, looking down for a second as if trying to process-OH MY-* **&quot;Wait, wha-&quot;** *And gone...just gone...again.* **&quot;WAIT A SECOND! You can&#x27;t just...I...HUH!?!?

You, me...your big floppy ears-oh hell.&quot;** *Chloe suddenly grabbed and hugged the gnoll, burying herself in his floof and just melting for a second. When she finally came back to her senses she pulled back, looked at him blankly, and just gave a quick **&quot;BYE!&quot;** before closing the door. She then stared at the door for a minute before walking over to her bed, falling into it, and burying her face in a pillow. She then screamed into it before kicking her legs a bit giggling. She hadn&#x27;t meant anything by it beyond him being a big adorable floof boy, but she had enjoyed hanging out with him.

I really appreciate it...and the helping me work out some stuff.&quot;** *She pulled her hair behind her ear, and had a shy look about her as she looked up to his ear as the twitched around a bit.

He scoffed a bit at the idea of wearing armor, preferring ordinary clothes as he felt that was a better way to tell a story. He was a bit glad (though couldn&#x27;t help but find it a bit strange, or maybe he was just a skeptic) that she never really pressed him about being, well, a 7 foot tall hyena person. Nevertheless though, he did enjoy himself quite a bit, occasionally yipping in surprise as their discussions got heated.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-21</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Really!?

Trying to look out the window*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-07</p> <p class="message">**&#x27;Oh come on in!&quot;** *Chloe said this on instinct not realizing the DANGER she had put them both in by doing so. HNNNNG! No, it was fine, so long as the door stayed open they would be fine. Perfectly fine...wow those pants were tight on her...FOCUS.* **&quot;Now where did I put those...&quot;** *She went over toward her bed where there were a number of drawers, opening them in search of her tools...while crouching over enough that Rui could see a lot more than Chloe might have intended. Those tights were great for running but not so much modesty...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-06-07</p> <p class="message">*Rui kinda looks at Chloe.  Trying to stay nice and calm and smile...but on the inside all she can hear.  FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK I was just letting her run up..and jeez those thighs...and that body and MRRRRRR focus!  What is inside the room.* **&quot;Wow...this is much cleaner then my room.&quot;** *As Rui pokes her head in...not sure if she should just stay outside or wait...she was just sweaty...it wouldn&#x27;t be to smart*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-07</p> <p class="message">*Chloe breathed heavily outside her room door, bent over a bit as she tried to catch her breath. Why had she run all the way here!? Why had she been in such a hurry!? She looked over and saw Rui...and kind of just froze. Crap. CRAP CRAP CRAP! She was here! She was in front of her room!? HER BED ROOM! WITH THE BED IN IT! Well of course she was, you told her to come, to get your smith&#x27;s tools so you could fix up your armor! Remember!? It was fine. This was fine. This was...fiiiiiine.* **&quot;Uh...sorry if it&#x27;s messy. I uh...I&#x27;m not...uh...&quot;** *Just open the door sweetie.  Chloe reached into her pocket for the key and opened the door to her room. It was...actually a pretty cute set up with a really nice window near the back and a loft where she did her reading. There was a nice little book shelf beside one wall and a plain looking clothes chest for her, well, clothes. There was also a nice little window garden with some potatoes and carrots growing in it, though it was anything crazy.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-07</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-14</p> <p class="message">*Chloe walked around her room, pondering if this would actually work or not. She had been figuring out a lot of new spells lately, seemingly by instinct, but this seemed like a bit...much. She had sort of just been sitting around channeling her magic into a few coins she had laid out before them &quot;telling them&quot; to turn into a sword. So you know...insanity. She let out a sigh and was about to give up when suddenly the coins began to glow, merging together into a really nice looking longsword!* **&quot;HOLY MACRONIE!&quot;** *Seriously? She shook her head and picked up the weapon, almost as if not believing it wasn&#x27;t real or might fall apart any second. But it didn&#x27;t. She swung it around a bit and it was as real as anything else in her room. It wasn&#x27;t even made of gold and had a fine leather handle wrap and everything! There was even a sheath! She felt like she couldn&#x27;t do something like this often but already her mind was racing with possibilities.* **&quot;Okay...this is weird. Cool...but weird. Wonder if Ethen could make use of...whatever this is...whatever I just did. Huh.&quot;** *She was going to have to have a LONG think about this.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-14</p> <p class="message">--------------------</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-11</p> <p class="message">*Chloe sat near her small window reading a book of old fairy tails, letting her mind drift off to adventures and places far from the guild. She never took enough time to relax like this and just let herself imagine and dream. She saw the position of the sun and decided to go get something to eat and see if any quests were available on the quest board, marking her book as she got up to change out of her more comfortable clothes. She stopped though and thought it over, looking down at her sweat shirt and tights. Maybe...maybe it was time to try being less formal. This place had become more like home, so maybe she could be  a little more relaxed. Slipping on her boots she took a deep breath and headed out of her room.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-11</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/709095867549745242/709193332290486442/WnW_Room_Options_8.jpg"/></li>
