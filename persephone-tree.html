They definitely needed to open up more over the course of their relationship, but alas, they&#x27;re love developed in a strange manner anyways, so screw the usual norm! Persephone was glad they were going at the pace they had, and little could change her mind about that. So.. she&#x27;d just lay there, with Demetrius laying on her warm fur, watching the starry heavens drift by until lord knows when. Who cared about time anyways. They had all the time in the world together.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-03-06</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Yeah...I like that idea.&quot;** *Demetrius looked up at the stars and let out a sigh, happy to just enjoy the moment. He knew things weren&#x27;t that simple, it never was, but he felt like they had taken a solid step forward in their relationship. At least that was what he wanted to believe.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-03-05</p> <p class="message">*Persephone giggled more as she heard Demetrius reply with such embarrassment, before putting her paws back around his waist to hold him.* **&quot;Well.. I suppose we should do what we came here to do?&quot;** *The druid leaned back, eyes cast back up to the vast heavens draped over them.. twinkling with stars unimaginably far away.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-03-05</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius sweated, totally not gulping as he leaned into Persephone.* **&quot;R-Right, of course, right, totally.&quot;** *He was embarrassed, sure, but he seemed happy enough.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-03-05</p> <p class="message">*Persephone, without realising, hadn&#x27;t revealed everything about her past to Demetrius too. Sure, he may have known of her closeness to Chauntea, but she had never told anyone of her connections to Talona too. How she managed to draw magics from complete opposites; a strange catalyst for abilities from deities who despised each other. It wasn&#x27;t a great memory after all, but alas, Persephone didn&#x27;t think it was important.. just as Demetrius may have thought his own past was not.* **&quot;I do.. I enjoy changing my clothes based on the season.. Different seasons have different appropriate natures to wear after all~&quot;** *Persephone internally grinned cunningly when Demetrius asked. She knew what he meant.. but playing dumb was fun!* **&quot;||If you mean *those* seasons though.. You&#x27;ll have to find out I suppose~||&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-03-04</p> <p class="message">*He snuggled into her, enjoying her warmth and soft fur, happy to have at least some of it off his chest. He hadn&#x27;t revealed everything, specifically how many lives he had taken during his time running around as a Nightslayer. Sure most were monsters or dastards of one variety or another...but it was a lot. More than he wanted to admit even to himself.* **&quot;Thank you Persephone. I&#x27;ll keep it in mind.&quot;** *He laid there quietly for a moment, not really saying much, until he asked something with a bit of hesitation and curiosity in his tone.* **&quot;So do you uh...have seasons like...nevermind.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-03-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;||Well.. some animals do visit others of the same species as them during certain seasons~||&quot;** *Persephone giggled slyly, clearly leaving a hint of something.. he&#x27;d be embarrassed by in her voice.* **&quot;||But I suppose you wouldn&#x27;t say they were working together.. or not in the way you mean I think..||&quot;** *The druid nuzzled into the top of his head more.. before just leaning back and enjoying their time together.* **&quot;||Thank you for telling me this all though.. If.. If you need any help dealing with your sister in the future, you can ask of me okay?||&quot;** *Persephone didn&#x27;t mind pranks and teasing, having done some herself, but if it got to a point where it wasn&#x27;t in good faith anymore, she was against it.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-03-03</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius heard the way she said uncle and realized she probably didn&#x27;t know much about that sort of relationship.* **&quot;It&#x27;s...the male sibling of your mother and father. Families can be close like that sometimes. In families the parents aren&#x27;t the only ones to help raise children, but also the siblings of parents and even the parents&#x27; parents. Families get extensive like that sometimes.&quot;** *He tried his best to explain it but wasn&#x27;t sure how well he was doing. He thought about that next part for a bit and supposed she was right about that. She could inflict far worse things upon him than she did, and that made him wonder.* **&quot;Visit them? Nah, it isn&#x27;t that kind of relationship. More like just...coworkers. Sort of like how animals don&#x27;t just visit other animals because they are the same species, if that makes sense.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-03-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Un.. cle?&quot;** *Uncles didn&#x27;t exist in the wild.. or at least the term didn&#x27;t. The wilderness and its beings had no need for such nomenclature of naming relatives&#x27; positions after all. She was glad Demetrius had good parents though. She knew the importance of good guardians after all even if she didn&#x27;t know what uncles or cousins may have been. A good parent or guardian would shape their young to become great people after all, and the half-orc laying upon her belly fur certainly was great.* **&quot;||Unseelie Court.. I&#x27;m familiar with them.||&quot;** *Persephone had.. cordial experiences with the fae. She didn&#x27;t like them too much due to how they did things, but they both had the same general goal of protecting nature in mind, so she was okay with them. Hearing that his sister was using their blessings in less than pleasant manners ticked her off though.* **&quot;||At least she doesn&#x27;t have the ability to put worse hexes and curses on you.. The fae have a lot harsher tricks up their sleeve.. which I do not wish upon someone as lovely as you.||&quot;** *She giggled before nuzzling his head again.* **&quot;||Ah.. that&#x27;s not too far I think.. Ever think of paying any of them a visit maybe?&quot;||**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-03-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;A father huh? I don&#x27;t know about that. My dad was a working man, carpentering and masonry mostly. Was a quite type with a jaw that could break boulders. My mom was a fire crackers, always knowing what to say and how to say it. One of the best archer&#x27;s you&#x27;ve ever seen to. I worry about them...&quot;** *He thought over his parents with a smile and then Dulgan again, letting out a little chuckle.* **&quot;No, Dulgan was more like an uncle. Every bit as much a good influence as a bad one. But I have to admit I wouldn&#x27;t be who I am today without him.&quot;** *His expression changes a bit when the conversation turns back to Triffany, letting out a loud scoff when Persephone asks if she were a Nightslayer.* **&quot;HA! No, not her. No way. She ran off and got herself involved with some hag, learned some magic, then got picked up by an Archfey. A daughter of the Unselee Queen or something along those lines. No, the curses she puts on me are little things, nuisances really, and breaking them is never a challenge. Annoys the piss out of me though.&quot;** *He took a moment to stew and then realized he skipped over part of her question.* **&quot;Ah, well, Dulgan goes up and down the Sword Coast looking for trouble, and there are five or six others that I know of, but I here quite a few live up north at Icewind and down south near Baldur&#x27;s gate, what with all the madness going on around there. Plenty of fiends and fiends worshipers to hunt.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-03-02</p> <p class="message">*Persephone stroked his chest with her large paw while listening to Demetrius detail his past, occasionally nuzzling into his hair to get more whiffs of him. She made sure to listen intently, though she didn&#x27;t understand some things of course. Dry humour? Teehee laughter stuff could be dry? She&#x27;d have to ask him about that some other time.* **&quot;||Dulgan.. sounds almost like a father figure with how you refer to him..||&quot;** *The druid giggled telepathically. She knew of some animals who would teach their young in that affectionately rough manner too.. whether it was the most effective though, she didn&#x27;t have an answer to, but Demetrius seems to have turned out fine! And those other beasts too. After listening to it all, she chimes in again.* **&quot;||Ah.. no wonder I couldn&#x27;t understand your mark.. Do you know of any other Nightslayers around though? And.. is your sister one too? She kept talking about a curse or something.. is.. is that related?||&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-03-02</p> <p class="message">*He closed his eyes and rested against her, knowing she was right about needing to share more. He just...worried. He knew he shouldn&#x27;t, but old habits could be hard to break sometimes. He took a breath and tried to clear his head, focusing on the details rather than the emotions surrounding them.* **&quot;I was working odd jobs in my home city, not really doing much with my life. Than I got in this fight, well, more of a beating with me on the receiving end, when this old guy jumped in and got me out of it. Dulgan...a laid back old bastard with humor so dry it made deserts look like an island resort.&quot;** *He laughed at this thought, rather enjoying that part of his past.* **&quot;He offered me a job, or an opportunity I guess. Help people, fight monsters, blah blah blah. He didn&#x27;t sugar coat it, but it sounded like a chance to make a difference. So I agreed. He trained me, which was a pain, but not half as bad as the crest.&quot;** *He rubbed his shoulder, not sure if the mark still hurt or if it was just a phantom pain. No...it still hurt.* **&quot;It&#x27;s elven...based on giant runes. It was created by a group of wood elf monster hunters, the first to be called Nightslayers. They found mostly undead and evil fey but eventually started having run ins with aberrations and fiends. That order broke up eventually, but remnants passed on their techniques, and the crest magic, to others. We aren&#x27;t organized really, just scattered individuals or smaller crews, but when things get rough we can still organize at least small groups. Otherwise we just sort of...do as we please.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-03-01</p> <p class="message">*Persephone stayed in her wolf form throughout his entire story, laying back so Demetrius could lay on her bellyfur where it was thicker and floofier. She nodded through it all, not understanding what a Nightslayer or 9 to 5 job really was, but she could connect enough dots to understand the gist of what her dear lover was trying to say.* **&quot;||You.. I won&#x27;t pressure you to tell me about your past now or whenever really.. I barely have much of a past to talk about so I can&#x27;t imagine if and how it may weigh on you. Just.. whenever you do feel comfortable though, do tell me please.. even if it may &#x27;ruin the moment&#x27; or something. We can always have our l-lovely moments together, but I&#x27;d appreciate if you told me more things about yourself more once in a while y&#x27;know~&quot;** *Persephone nuzzled into the top of her head, hugging him gently with her big ol&#x27; paws.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-02-27</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius was deep in thought for most of the trip, not saying much until they reached their destination. Then there it all was...the cosmos. He looked up at it all wide eyed, caught off guard by it all as he felt like a child stargazing for the first time. The moment lasted for a while before he finally let out a decompressing sigh and slid off Persephone&#x27;s back, putting an arm around her lupine form.* **&quot;Thank you. I needed this.&quot;** *He then just stared up and held her for a while before finally speaking again.* **&quot;Me and my sister never really got along growing up, at least not as far as I can remember. She always wanted more than our parents or anyone else could give her, and me...I was never sure what I wanted beyond a meal and a bed to lay on. Then one day she was gone, ran away to find what she thought she deserved. It was only a few years after that I met Dulgan, my mentor, and got this mark. Became a Nightslayer.&quot;** *He stopped again and let out a surreal sort of laugh before petting his girlfriend lightly.* **&quot;I guess I haven&#x27;t told you much about my past up until now, have I? I guess I just didn&#x27;t want to think about all that. Like my arrogant sister putting curses on me as pranks from time to time or me and my mentor killing monsters and stuff like it was a 9 to 5 job. I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ve ever talked about Dulgan or my parents before. I guess I was just trying to keep in the moment forever or something.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-27</p> <p class="message">*Persephone shook a little to make sure Demetrius had proper seating on her back first, and when she had ensured he had held onto her firmly, began a brisk pace forward. The druid wasn&#x27;t exactly running, nor was she walking.. just a relatively speedy trot forwards. The spot wasn&#x27;t far from the ruins they lived in, and after about 5 minutes of travelling.. Persephone slowed down. She began a trek uphill with Demetrius hopefully still clinging on to her soft fluffy warm fur.. and eventually breaks past the canopy to reach the peak of a hill. It was clear of trees, and hanging above them.. the heaven of stars and the galaxy beyond sparkled like a dream.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-02-26</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius felt her nuzzling and just let out a sigh, climbing onto her and hugging as much as riding her to the clearing. He hadn&#x27;t told her much about his past, he knew that, and part of him had never wanted to. No though It seemed like he had to. No, he wanted to. She needed to know the mess that was the life of Demetrius Swiftwind.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-26</p> <p class="message">*What. On. Toril. Who. On. Toril. Persephone was watching wide-eyed, mouth agape the whole time. She didn&#x27;t understand what was happening the whole time despite her hearing every word of the conversation. What caught her attention most was the curse upon Demetrius though. Despite them having been extremely close, his mark was a topic which she hadn&#x27;t bothered to prod much about at all. Persephone had felt is was extremely personal, and would let the half-orc tell her at his own volition. Hearing his supposed twin sister who she had never heard about suddenly pop up and spill so much about it felt so odd though. The druid wasn&#x27;t mad at Demetrius for not telling her though.. but she wanted some answers as soon as possible. Persephone leaned in and planted a kiss on her dear half-orc&#x27;s neck, before moving out of his hold to shift into a dire wolf.* **&quot;||Hop on. You can tell me about.. whatever that was.. when we get there.||&quot;** *She nuzzled Demetrius a little with her wolf snout.* **&quot;I shall remain here.. definitely not to get a third.. or fourth bowl.&quot;** *Hermes added in his low voice, scampering off to a more secluded bushy area to eat in safety since he wouldn&#x27;t have the two&#x27;s protection for a bit.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-02-25</p> <p class="message">*Triffany, as was apparently her name, just adopted this incredulous expression as she looked at Demetrius.* **”Is that anyway to talk to your sister!? Much less your way more mature, beautiful, and a thousand times more cultured TWIN SISTER! GAWD! You are ALWAYS like this! I thought the curse I gave you that let you feel the way I do and stuff would finally make you understand how much it hurts to be rejected by absolutely everyone just because you are so much better than they are!”** *She flips her hair, seeming exasperated and high on her own bullshit.*

**”Firstly, is that why I’ve been blacking out in the arena and waking up smelling like cheap perfume and loathing!? Secondly, no one likes you because you’re an unapologetic BITCH!”** *He yells, eyes still wide and finger pointing toward her.*

*She just scoffs, looking more pissed off than upset and just raises her hand to him, “talk to the hand style”.* **”I don’t have time for your self-righteousness or whatever. I have vengeance to plan. If you’re not going to live in an actual house with an actual woman worth living with then I’ll grace someone else with my presence. I’m even taking my curse back! You don’t deserve to feel as absolutely AMAZING or be half as HAWT as I am! Later LOSER!”** 

*She gives him a forehead L and then vanishes in another puff of smoke, Demetrius just standing there with eyes bulging, breathing fast and heavy, and this vein on his forehead just visibly throbbing. He then sits down, puts his arm back around Persephone, and just...exhales.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-02-25</p> <p class="message">*As the two speak, discussing everything, suddenly there is a puff of smoke as a figure appears behind them. She lets out a LOOOOONG sigh that Demetrius seems to instantly recognize, all the blood draining from his face as his eyes widen with a look of fear and anguish that Persephone had never seen upon him before.* **”Oh God no…”**

**”DEMETRIUS!!! These jerks messed up this AWESOME party I hijacked and tried to act like they were all hot and shit! UGH! I hate them SO MUCH! Wait, are you like living in a tree or something? Who does that!? I was gonna ask to crash with you but not if you’re squatting in some forest with...what a tomboy? HAHAHA! That’s SOOOOO like you! GAWD! You&#x27;re such a pedestrian! And after I put that curse on you so you could feel the way I do and stuff! UGH! Why do I even bother trying to make you understand me! OH MY GAWD you are SOOOO hopeless!”** *The figure was a female half-orc that...looked a lot like Demetrius. Too much like him. It was uncanny, except for like the being a pretty hot girl and all.*

**”No. NONONONO. NO!”** *Demetrius just said this while standing up, wide eyed and seeming on the verge of a nervous breakdown...or fit of rage...or both. Probably both.* **”Triffany! Go Away!”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-02-25</p> <p class="message">*He was surprised by Hermes&#x27; kiss, having not expected it but then just smiling in response. Yeah, he cared for the little bunny, he wasn&#x27;t sure when that had started but he really did. That said Persephone&#x27;s question caught him off guard, namely that last part. Ride? R-Really? He&#x27;d be lying if he said the though hadn&#x27;t crossed his mind once or twice, riding on Persephone while she was in wolf form. It seemed really weird but also kind of...exciting. Riding a dire wolf was probably the single most metal thing he could think of, and for that dire wolf to be his amazing girlfriend on top of that? Then again a race could be fun to, though he doubted he&#x27;d have a chance of competing with Persephone on her own turf. Still that sort of thing was fun, so honestly both options seemed really appealing.* **&quot;Well...you know where the spot is so...maybe this time you show me and next time we race?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2021-02-25</p> <p class="message">*Hermes hopped up to kiss Demetrius&#x27; hand cutely; a sign of affection and gratitude for the good cooking before he got right back to eating like a savage beast.. which in of itself was an adorable sight too.* **&quot;S-Sure..&quot;** *Persephone was likely going to try and go on a quest herself first though. She didn&#x27;t want to seem to out of her element with Demetrius after all! The druid snuggles in when he puts his arm around her, purring while looking up at him.* **&quot;Want a race or a ride to the spot I know?&quot;** *She giggled.. leaving the competitive choice in the air, though she&#x27;d certainly not mind letting him mount her as a wolf to bring him there.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-02-24</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius got another spoon full for Hermes, still petting Persephone and musing a bit with her.* **&quot;We should go together sometime.

She had always been curious about it, having accidentally been roped into one which Chauntea had called upon her aid for. The druid had considered joining one.. but had been to shy to properly enter the guild. The last time she did was just for a very short sign-up, and after that was processed fully, she was out the door and sprinting back to the safety of her forest abode with her dear half-orc. She was idly eating her stew through it all, having finished her bowl too before realising she was practically purring while he pat her.* **&quot;Hmm.. maybe I should join one soon..&quot;** *Hermes was done eating as well, currently cleaning a bone of its meat and marrow.

It brought great dynamic changes to her life, and though they had not integrated their knowledge together completely yet - her still being more attuned to a life woven with nature while he was still more attuned to a life sprouted from civilisation - she didn&#x27;t mind. They complimented each other&#x27;s skillsets perfectly, and besides.. he had opened up her mind to **lots** more she never would have known about if she continued her enclosed life in the wilderness.

He had pulled out the big pot, seeming to make enough to feed a small army, but honestly he knew it wouldn&#x27;t last more than a day or two between the three of them. He let out a sigh, not so much out of frustration but just amazement that he had basically become a homekeeper of sorts. Then again their home was the forest and Persephone was its keep so maybe he wasn&#x27;t even that.

She gets a mix of flowers and such from which her scent derived from.. as well as a gem she picked up and some twine. The druid begins to channel her magic through the gem.. infusing the mixed scents into it, before she used the twine and attached it to the gem to make a necklace! Persephone was extremely satisfied with how it turned out.. and she couldn&#x27;t resist but cheekily grin while holding up the amulet she had just made. The gem was still warm to the touch, and when she kisses it, a little glimmer of green light appears in its translucent golden centre. It smelled like her too, so Demetrius would have liked that right?

He wondered if more than the actual magic of the weapon if it wasn&#x27;t how much it eased and cleared his mind that made him shoot so well with it. Meh, better not to think too hard about it.

Discreetly, the Kalashtar would do her best to slot the new bow back into his quiver.. but gah.. he smelled too good!

Dang, there was only one person who could make his tough visage fall away and make him into a bumbling blushing idiot...and it was the woman before him.* **&quot;D-Don&#x27;t look like that! We&#x27;re having deer and mushroom stew. You&#x27;re favorite.&quot;** *At least they were now.. How could he not make her whatever she wanted after making her look so conflicted?* **&quot;And I&#x27;ll make that sweet pudding you like to...we still have some bread left over from last time that should work for a base...so...take your time with whatever it is you&#x27;re doing....&quot;** *He reached over and rubbed her head a bit.* **&quot;Sorry to tease you like that...Persy...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-24</p> <p class="message">https://pa1.narvii.com/5792/32a77023b267c7996735ea2f88865e225005f191_hq.gif</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-24</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Huh? B-But.. hmmmgh..&quot;** *Persephone steps back a little, rocking on the back of her heels as she considered revealing it to him now. It wasn&#x27;t perfect yet though! There was so much more she could add! Would he be happy with just this? She didn&#x27;t know! Persephone wanted her first gift for him to be perfect though.. but dinner was pretty important too.. decisions decisions.. so many to make. The Kalashtar&#x27;s cheeks just burned more as she looked down and tried to think of a proper solution.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-11-23</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh, well maybe if you shared what you were doing with me I might reconsider. Maaaaybe.&quot;** *He said childishly, trying to hide what he was preparing from her with a smile. Yes it was juvenile. Yes he was a grown ass man. Yes he loved every second of teasing her. Being with Persephone made him feel...lighter, and he loved that he could just have fun with her. He...hadn&#x27;t had that for a long time in his life.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-23</p> <p class="message">*Persephone&#x27;s giggling and struggling stopped when she felt Demetrius&#x27; lips press up against her own, her entire body freezing for a second before she melted into him. When he finally let go of her, she was a blushing mess.* **&quot;||Stupid c-city boy..||&quot;** *The druid sighed as she recuperated for a moment, before hearing what he said. The audacity! Persephone immediately rushed after him to his work station, trying to get a peek of what he was working on.* **&quot;H-Hey! That isn&#x27;t fair.. dinner is important!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-11-22</p> <p class="message">*He continued a bit before putting his arms around her waist and pulling her in closer, looking into her eyes and leaning in to kiss her. He held the kiss for a while before pulling back.* **&quot;Well, if you insist on keeping it a secret, then I&#x27;ll just keep dinner a secret from now on.&quot;** *He pulled away from her with a smug grin before heading back over to his own work station to start in on...something. He wasn&#x27;t telling what it was though.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-20</p> <p class="message">**&quot;||What&#x27;re you planning, odd city boy.. Looking at me like a predator watching his next meal-||&quot;** **&quot;H-Hey!&quot;** *Persephone cut off her telepathy when Demetrius began tickling her, the druid giggling as her cheeks flared up uncontrollably.* **&quot;S-Stop! Gah- hnngh.. Demetrius! I&#x27;m not- hehehehe.. n-not hiding anything!&quot;** *Persephone struggled to get out, not being very resistant against Demetrius&#x27; tactics. She was very ticklish after all, and the half-orc was using the weakness against her! What an evil fiend! Persephone loved him no matter what though, even though she was protesting and slapping his arm while laughing.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-11-19</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius narrows his eyes again before slowly approaching her. He gets closer and closer, staring at her nervous demeanor, eyes staring at her menacingly. He reaches his hand out toward her...and start tickling her.* **&quot;What are you hiding! Tell me your secrets!!! You can&#x27;t hide them from me!!!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-19</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-19</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-19</p> <p class="message">**&quot;WHAT!?&quot;** *Persephone looked down at her hand. The bow wasn&#x27;t there anymore! Did he see it before she could retract it back on to herself? Well.. she was the best liar around! He wouldn&#x27;t find out that easily, right?* **&quot;As if I&#x27;d have a bow! Why would I have one at all, odd city boy? It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;d spend time to make something nice for you!&quot;** *The Kalashtar sticks her tongue out.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-11-19</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius looked toward Persephone and narrowed his eyes. Narrowed. Narrower. Narrowest. He then shrugged and went to put them on her station. She was just acting like Persephone honestly so he didn&#x27;t think much of the outburst. Well...no more than he usually would.* **&quot;Did Chauntea give you a new power? The tattoo and bow look really nice.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;HIBISCUS! HONEY! BLOSSOMS!&quot;** *Persephone immediately jumped up when she heard her dear half-orc returning back to their humble abode. They had really improved the area, making it a perfect harmony of nature and civilisation in the form of architecture. The Kalashtar had drawn the magical bow she had made with Chauntea&#x27;s blessing into herself, similarly as she would with her own staff. A new tattoo of vines and tendril-like roots appeared on her other arm, and she slowly turned to face Demetrius, hoping her random screams distracted him enough.* **&quot;Oh.. hey odd city boy.. Just put &#x27;em on my work station and I&#x27;ll prepare them.&quot;** *Smooth, Persephone. Smooth.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-11-18</p> <p class="message">*Demetrius wandered through the brush, having gone out to collect some mushrooms and herbs for the camp. There garden had become quite impressive but he still liked to wander and see what he could find. It was weird, living like this, yet he couldn&#x27;t deny he had been enjoying it. The forest wasn&#x27;t like the city or the road, and his life now was far less stressful than what it had once been.*

*Hunting monsters...had done that for years, ever since his mentor picked him up somewhere along the way and taught him the techniques before giving Demetrius a Slayer&#x27;s Mark. The strange magical thing on his back still tingled on occasion, warning him of threats, but for the most part even it had been calmer. He figured it was because of the simpler life he had found living with her.*

*With Persephone...*

*He loved her, he knew that now, but it was still so sudden. One day she was just this person he felt a need to watch over for fear of others trying to manipulate her, or that she might become a monster herself that threatened others. Then it became attraction, then infatuation. Then it was something deeper than that, all in the span of a few weeks. Now, months later, he knew it was love, and that scared the shit out of him.*

*He loved her and had no idea what to do with that other than...well...to love her. It was a complicated emotion, stressful at times yet wonderful always. Always. So yeah...he was in love, and that was something he could certainly live with.*

*He passed by the little cabin he had made for himself near the great tree in the center of the old ruins that he and Persephone called home, part of him missing Page who had left back on her own adventures but also enjoying the privacy he and Persephone had here now. Well....besides Hermes and the other animals that would come visit Persephone at times, but for the most part it was just them.* 

**&quot;Persephone! I found some Troll Caps and King&#x27;s Root! Should be good for-&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-18</p><p class="message">(for reference, something like this)</p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/775364858069254194/778586645741830154/217612a101664b9d9c207dae90fc73c0.png"/></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-18</p> <p class="message">*The Kalashtar got right to work, walking up to her tree and pressing her palm up against the rough bark. She then slowly pulls back, and tendrils of wood began to wind out along with her.. turning into a long thin, yet sturdy, branch. Persephone&#x27;s arm slowly became wreathed in greenish gold light as she pressed back a little.. causing the branch to curve as she wished. Persephone then plucked some hemp hanging off one of the higher branches, and stuck each end to the end of either arc of the curved branch.*

*In a swift motion, she kicked the branch off the tree, somersaulting back a little as the shape of her creation was complete. She held the bow up, magic flowing through her arm along the wooden arc and tight bowstring to make it tight and sturdy, yet remain flexible enough to fire an arrow well. Some leaves grew at the top arc, with a few different flowers which would end up mimicking what she usually smelled like. This was still just a relatively normal bow though.. so she decided to take it a step further.*

*Persephone puts the bow on the ground and kneels before it, open palms facing it as she closes her eyes.* **&quot;Hey Auntie Chauntea? I&#x27;m.. making something for someone I.. uh.. l-love.. Help me a little?&quot;** *Nothing happened for a few moments, but her tattoos wreathing her arm seem to glimmer softly. Tiny golden orbs of light seem to be expelled forth from her palms, along with green ethereal tendrils which wrapped around the bow. It made the arc of the weapon proper, and ensure the bowstring was just tight enough. The little patch of greenery at the top was enchanted a little too, and Persephone&#x27;s scent from it would be more detectable.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Indeed. Gifts are common between romantic partners.&quot;** *Hermes&#x27; deep voice reverberated softly while he was snuggled up in Persephone&#x27;s cleavage. The little black bunny&#x27;s head was scratched softly by his owner, who was tapping her foot on the ground rhythmically. The druid sighed a little before leaning back on to the bark of her tree home which she had been sharing with Demetrius for quite a while. Little much had changed since he first began staying with her, except the work area had been expanded a little more.*

**&quot;What would he like, though? Do odd city boys like flowers? Maybe I could make him a new fur coat.. Hm..&quot;** *Persephone wracked her brain further while getting off the tree, and beginning to pace around it. Demetrius had done so much for her, assisting her in exploring emotions she understood little and in her daily duty to upkeep the balance of nature. What would be really useful for him? Hm.. maybe a new skinning knife for hunts.. or new boots to traverse the lands more easily.. or maybe even a bow?*

**&quot;A bow!&quot;** *Persephone&#x27;s eyes suddenly lit up, her golden irises glimmering brightly as a smile spread on her face. A bow would be great! Demetrius spent lots of time preparing arrows, but his old bow seemed to receive only simple maintenance. How could she get him a new bow though.. The druid kicked a rock, which bounced along the ground before skipping up to the tree and hitting the wood.. and then it hit her. She had just the right material for it!*
