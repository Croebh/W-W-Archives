			<li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-28</p> <p class="message">*After some more relationship talk and disasembling Kjaras Bed to build a sizeable pillow fort around the redish hued dragonborns assembly of couches, the two childhood friends sat in their pajamas, accompanied by a fresh pie of pizza, together and just enjoyed their reunion. Kyaio was playing some chill tunes on her perculiar guitar while Kjara was just vibing to the tunes.*

**&quot;Those are some realy cool sounds that guitar can make... Completely different then acustic ones... I&#x27;ve heared Aghayon playing some time on his but this sounds nothing like his!&quot;** Kjara says before reaching over, grabbing a slice of Pizza and starts nibbling on it while she pulls her knees to her chest.

**&quot;Hell yeah! Made it myself! As far as I am aware you will be hard pressed to find one like these babys anywhere near here!&quot;** *Kyaio says with a big smile on her face, strumming her strings in a happy tune.* **&quot;And as much as I love playing acustic, this is way more fun!&quot;** *She says with a giggle.* **&quot;Especialy since it tickles whenever I strum a chord since i get some feedback through my arm.&quot;** *She says, holding up her prosthetic where a cable was connecting the Guitar to her elbow that housed a drum full of cables.*

**&quot;Still pretty cool! By the way... Anything new from  home?&quot;** *She asks, suckling a little on a piece of crust from her pizza.*

**&quot;Eh not much... Leila got herself knocked up by a farmhand on her parents farm, Lori went to silverymoon to become a wizard and Sheila is now a pre-school teacher... For the others i don&#x27;t know. After you left I didn&#x27;t realy made much contact with our classmates... I worked a lot with my dads unit during the time and helped setting up the quarantine camp...&quot;** *She says in a somber tone before she grabs a piece of pizza and takes a bite.* **&quot;Oh shit! This is nearly as good as Gnormios!&quot;** *She exclaims suprised!,*

**&quot;Right? The Pizza alone is nearly worth joining!&quot;** *Kjara says, grabbing another slice.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-24</p> <p class="message">*Kjara just trys to hide her face but the dumb grin on her face shines true just a bit to much.* **&quot;So... What base you&#x27;re on?&quot;** *Kyaio asks with a sly grin as she gets up.* **&quot;Come on girl, you can tell me!&quot;** *She says with the most smug grin imaginable on her face.*

**&quot;I... i think still first base? I mean... I... I got some good cuddling in at the beach but... He.. He... I think Vian didn&#x27;t had a girlfriend before so...&quot;** *Kyaio starts laughing at that and then looks around Kjaras crib before finaly spotting a little stash with some wine bottles and just grabs one to pop one open and getting some glasses for the two.* **&quot;So you just need to work harder then! Get that hunka chunk to swoon over you like you swoon over him!&quot;** *She says, filling the two some generous glasses full of wine and takes a good big sip of the wine before sitting down again.*

**&quot;Oh shut it! I can&#x27;t just go up to Vian and go all out! He&#x27;s... Well... It&#x27;s hard to discribe but there is a cultural barrier that we still need to work out... i bet I would insult him if i just would kiss him or something...&quot;** *She says, looking at the glas of wine in her hand before taking a sip.* **&quot;Though... he said that he was happy when I was happy so... maybe I need to do the first step? I don&#x27;t know...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-24</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Realy? Damn! only people I know here are already under the hammer... Well good I have you then! or do you have a boy slash girlfriend as of now I should know of?&quot;** *She asks and if Kjara could become any redder she would right now!* **&quot;OOHH?&quot;** *Kyaio leans forward with a wolfish grin on her face.* **&quot;You need to tell me everything girlfriend! Every little dirty dete!&quot;** *She says and Kjara just buries her face in her hands.* **&quot;I... i&#x27;m crushing on a prince from a far away land! he&#x27;s a total hunk and gods...&quot;** *She just... wanted to sink into the chair and just die of shame but Kyaio got her girl as she reached over with her weird wing and hugged Kjara from afar.* **&quot;Damn Girl! You need to introduce me to him then if hes so swoonable!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-24</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Eh don&#x27;t sweat it K-J! If I can&#x27;t crash here I just go to your brother. Bet he doesn&#x27;t mind having some hot blue ass for a change!&quot;** *Kyaio says with a grin as she lounges on the couch, spreading out her wings a little.*

**&quot;Don&#x27;t think thats a good Idea... Kessan&#x27;s engaged you know?&quot;** *Kjara says, crossing her legs on the reclainer she was sitting on. God it hat been such a long time since she had seen Kyaio and she hadn&#x27;t changed a bit! Well except being more matured then last time and... well... Having wings and a robot arm...*

**&quot;Oh whaa? He got a new girl? Dang! Didn&#x27;t knew that scrawny nerd would hit another one! Well... there goes that idea... What about your old crush? Heard the simp was here as well!&quot;** *If Kyaio was honest, hearing that Kessan had a new girl kinda stung actualy! She knew he had a hard time after the whole cult thing and the two of them always had a great chemistry going with both of them loving to tinier but when he left Cormyr she never got to talk to him before that. But oh well... if the nerd was happy then she would not be the one to step onto that relationship.*

*Kjara in the meanwhile sat very stiff and upright there.* **&quot;Aghayons currently dating someone I think!&quot;** *She says because when Kyaio said crush she had the fear now that she might encounter Vian and Kjara was not sure how he would handle someone as straight forward as Kyaio...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-24</p> <p class="message">*Kyaio chuckles, playing some more on her Guitar, playing some more soothing tones on the weird instrument.* **&quot;Well...&quot;** *She says, waving her prosthetic around a bit.* **&quot;I wanted to do some cool stuff with my electrizity and blew my arm of. As for the wings... Thats a bit harder to explain... Couple of month&#x27;s ago they just popped out of my back... Don&#x27;t ask me why but the new muscles did wondersfor my chest and back pain! I gained a whole new cup size and the backpains are gone!&quot;** *She said, leaning forward a bit and grinned at Kjara who was still suoer perplexed at her old friend.*

**&quot;Alright... But ... How did you get in here? And how did you know it was my room?&quot;** *Kjara asks more but the blue dragonborn just chuckles, unplugging her guitar and puts it next to her backpack that was resting at the foot of the couch.* **&quot;Well, I saw you at the window! You might be older now but I won&#x27;t forgett those dreads and red scales anytime soon! Also, your window was open so I slipped right in! You don&#x27;t mind me crashing here for the time being while I check out that guild of yours right?&quot;** *She asks and kjara didn&#x27;t know what to say.* **&quot;Uhm... sure... though we need to get you a guest pass first... you can&#x27;t just stay here without one...&quot;** *She says, sitting down and contemplating how Kyaio staying here would change things around her for a while.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-24</p> <p class="message">*Kjara was currently drying her scalie dreads as she heard a weird noise comming from her living room area an narows her eyes, taking one of the many hidden belts of daggers that are hidden in her living quarters and wraps it around her waist as she sneaks towards the door in just her underwear. Who would have the guts to sneak into her room? She silently opens the door of her bathroom and uses the cupboard next to the door as cover to see a flash of light blue lounging on her couch while weird sounding riffs came from there. &quot;Who is that?&quot; Kjara thoughts as she slowly sneaked over to her bed, looking for her card deck but couldn&#x27;t find it. She supressed a growl and instead pulled the bracer of cards from a hidden place beneath her bed and puts it out before pulling out a dagger. Whoever hat was on her couch would regrett this intrusion! Kjara slowly sneaks over to the couch and then, quickly reaches around and holds the intruder at knife point.* **&quot;Who are you?&quot;** *She asks in a very threatening tone but she only gets a chuckle.* **&quot;Paranoid much?&quot;** *Kyaio said, making Kjara drop her knife as she realized who that was on her couch!* 

**&quot;K? Is that you?&quot;** *She asks suprised before Kyaio turned her head and smirks at the redish hued dragonborn.*

**&quot;Hell yeah i am! Hows it goin Princess! thought you kicked the bucket!&quot;**

**&quot;The hell do you got here? What are you doing in here?&quot;** 

**&quot;Easy! Your nerd of a brother send my dad some letters over the year and I wanted to check this place out!&quot;** *Kyaio says grinning while Kjara puts the dagger away and walks around the couch to see her old friend chilling on the couch though... A lot of things were different.*
**&quot;Go on, I know what ya wanna ask!&quot;** The blue dragonbord says with a grin.

**&quot;What happend to your arm? And whats with the wings?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-01-24</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>

She was weaeing a single ring made from gold around the midsection of the limb. It was the only jewelry she was wearing at this point, leaving her choker behind because this looked more classy without it.* **&quot;I... I had an Idea of something... A dish I am quite fond of and wich is very popular in these parts... I wonder if you will like it...&quot;** *She says as she takes the leisure of going ahead slowly towards the Guild hall and the &lt;#737045615518679080&gt;.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-26</p> <p class="message">He nodded with a soft &quot;mmm&quot; And stepped aside so that the red dragonborn could step out of her room. *Why am I nervous*, he wondered. *What is this foolishness?* The desert dweller put a hand casually on his sword hilt, a comfortable place to rest it, a familiar and relaxing feeling. **&quot;We shall.&quot;** He was a bit stiff, wasn&#x27;t he?

This was the first formal date she had in a while and... given how it came to be she felt a little bit awkward as well but... She actualy realy wanted this.* **&quot;Shall we... go?&quot;** *She asks, basicly giving Vian a last chance to either bail out or accept his fate that he would go on a date with Kjara this late evening.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-26</p> <p class="message">His hands clasped behind his back, his own eyes looking down over himself. He never much liked the formal clothes, of his people or, really, any people he&#x27;d seen. His normal robes, loose and airy to help with the heat of the desert, with the movement of his fighting. He liked those. They felt natural. Like a second skin, at this point.  Awkwardly, he nodded. **&quot;...Thank you. I do prefer my usual attire to this, but I have been told it &#x27;looks good.&#x27; &quot;** So... Now what happened?</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-26</p> <p class="message">*Kjara put a hand in front of her mouth as she let out a little giggle. It was a while since she had to use her manners as a noblewoman but at the moment it seemed appropriate.* **&quot;Thank you for the compliment.&quot;** *She said, her clear blue eyes meeting his gaze and it was obvious that she was happy about the little compliment.* **&quot;And I have to admit... formal clothes suit you as well...&quot;** *She says warmly before she breaks the eye contact with him. She had no idea what was going on in his mind or what thoughts botherd him but she knew that she was glad that she, A couldn&#x27;t blush and B had redish scales to hide it just in case.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-26</p> <p class="message">She did look nice. Vian looked down her body probably the first time since they had met, when he stared at her tail almost obsessed. He caught his mistake, though his ears tweaked and mane puffed a bit, displeased he had made it. He turned his head a bit, looking away as if to dismiss his error. **&quot;Indeed. Blues are... the color of my household banner. It also looks...&quot;** He turned to look at her eyes again. **&quot; Nice. On you.&quot;** Truth told, he had only really looked at her the way a warrior might: Analyzing, questioning, thinking. Now all sorts of thoughts were shouting in the back of his head, and he felt more distracted than he ever had before.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-26</p> <p class="message">*After a long evening of recapping and catching up, Kjara was exhausted. She had to go through so much with her brother. Not only on what happend to her, how she survived and why she didn&#x27;t come home... And because he was such an huge Idiot! Why did he talk to Vian about courtship just because they would go on a date? Jeez! He had such a huge brain but... Sometimes he just didn&#x27;t think at all. She had a restless night and used most of the following day to rest and get ready. She was glad for the delay though becase she could actualy pick something to wear this time without to much pressure. 

After Vian knocked at the door did it not take long before the door opend. Inside stood Kjara, her scales polished to a shine, her scaled dreadlocks bound to a loose ponytail that fell over her shoulder. She was wearing a form fitting night blue cocktail stile dress. It was simple but it made her redish hued scales realy pop and played perfectly into her curvy body. 
There was a warm smile on her face as she placed one hand over the bracer over her forearm. The ornate leather piece was deffinetly fine and elegant enough to be considerd part of the ensamble.*

**&quot;Looks like we both have a similiar taste in color for formal occasions...&quot;** *Her voice had a flustered tone.* **&quot;Good evening Vian...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-26</p> <p class="message">A day passes, leaving Vian to stew in his thoughts and try to collect himself. He didn&#x27;t understand, still, the idea of casually pursuing someone like this. Was that Kjara&#x27;s interest? Was he so blind to what was no doubt a common thought in this land? He mused to himself, as he tried to read up on the phenomena in some books late at night, that he was a pretty sought after individual, in terms of qualities: Strong, agile, young, healthy, sharp in mind and of royal blood on top of his growing mastery of his fighting school...

But these were the sorts of things that were used to secure alliances. Did she seek to become a mistress? Did he *seek a mistress*? How much of this was foolishness, by him and by others? Surely she knew his obligation to return home, and one day secure a strong bond to one of the great clans through marriage... All of it made his head dizzy, the desert dragonborn falling asleep late into the evening with candles still burning.

So, the time came. He found himself still nervous, wearing some slightly different clothes: Instead of the loose robes he often had in whites and blues, he had on a form fitting shirt and pants of navy blue so dark it was almost black. The gold embroidery on it was both elegant and beautiful, possibly gaudy if not for his subdued nature. He waited at her door for a minute longer than he planned, adjusting his ceremonial sword belt, less comfortable than his sash but certainly finer... And knocked at her door, finally, his frown creased into his face like cracks in a mountain.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*As the door closes Vian can here some shouting coming from the room and repeated slapping noises.*

**&quot;WHAT WERE YOU THINKING!&quot;** *What was deffinetly Kjaras voice followed by some muddled words as answers. In time the two woud make up and be just sister and brother again. They had a lot... A LOT of catching up to do.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">Vian offers a bow back, still processing much of this information. **&quot;Tomorrow.&quot;** And with that, he leaves.

**&quot;Now Kjara! Please! I just wanted to explain...&quot;**

**&quot;You shut up Kessan or I do with you what Larken did to you before Aghayon could between you two!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">Vians attention snapped to reality as Kessan was floored by a wooden bucket to the face, the desert prince jumping back. Eyes flicked up to Kjara, hearing and seeing her fury.  He did what his instincts told him to do: bow and back out of the room. **&quot;I... apologize for the poor timing. Tomorrow, then.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Kessan lets out a sigh and holds his head. And seeing that Vian probably needed a little reboot, Kessan got up and looked at the Dragonborn.* **&quot;Ah sorry Vian...&quot;** *He says with a sigh. Kessan hadn&#x27;t anticipated such reactions and again, his impulsiveness had left it&#x27;s marks. He could clearly see the confusion on the desert dragonborns face and let out another sigh.* **&quot;If your words are true and you realy mean that you take everything seriously then this should go well anyway...&quot;** *He says before looking over to the bathroom. **&quot;If you want to court my Sister I can hardly stop you since she appearantly...&quot;** The door opens up and Kjara throws a bucket at her brother wich hits him square in the head.*

**&quot;SHUSH! Vian! Sorry for this but I take your proposal to move our dinner to tomorrow! I need to punch my brother for a solid hour be ause he is an Idiot!&quot;** *Kjara says, now wearing a bathrobe as she walks over to Kessan who was laying on his back, rubbing his nose.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">The desert dragonborn watched the silver for a few moments, blinking golden eyes once as his mane stood up on end, fluffing up it&#x27;s volume. Courtship. Yes, it had to be different in these lands, didn&#x27;t it? Or even amongst... People not quite like him and his family. Weren&#x27;t they nobles in their own right? **&quot;But...&quot;** His brow furrowed more, the look of consternation and attempt to understand growing deeper and struggling, even as Kjara breaks his chain of thought with her shout. Dumbfounded, he just stood there, not understanding the idea that some people actively seek romantic entanglements. And he had learned a long time ago, when you are confused, remain silent. So he did, his eyes avoiding any eye contact and zoning out in an attempt to piece together this strange puzzle.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Kjara and Kessan shared a look and then both looked at Vian.

**&quot;Yeah... Deffinetly needs time to acclimate.&quot;** *Kessan says and ponders if he should spill the beans but he could already feel the daggers his Sister would stare at him if he would say anything... Then again.* **&quot;You know Vian... Dating is a form of courtship in these lands... Or rather the form...&quot;** 

*Kjara looked at her brother as if he just dropped the mightiest of bombs onto Vian and she buries her face into her hands in emberrasment. HOW  COULD HE JUST DROP THAT SO CASUALY?*
**&quot;Why are you such an Idiot with such a giant brain Kessan!&quot;** *She says as she quickly runs into her bathroom.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">He had evidence that she could indeed care for herself.

Life is too short to waste time on...

**&quot;Don&#x27;t be such a gatekeeper Kessan! I&#x27;m a grown woman! I can take care of myself!&quot;** *She says with a huff as the silver dragonborn rubs the back of his head.

He&#x27;s from pretty far away you know?&quot;** *She explains and Kessan let&#x27;s out a sigh.

**&quot;Alright... But if this becomes serious between you two then...&quot;** *Kessan catches another bonk on the head for that and starts chuckling while Kjara pouts.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">Vian raised his chin indignantly. **&quot;Clearly you two have much to talk about. It seems unnecessary for me to interrupt this. Kjara, perhaps tomorrow would be more opportune in the face of recent circumstances.&quot;** Really, it was an awkward situation, wasn&#x27;t it? And it would only be made more awkward trying to inject some sort of normalcy into it. 14 years of not seeing eachother, to be reunited here? Even Vian could see the reason Kessan was riled up.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Kessan lets his sister go and goes to a knee a bit. He had grown a lot after the last time he saw her and it was weird to look down to her so much.* **&quot;Where have you been?&quot;** *He asks her but she cuts him off.* **&quot;I realy want to catch up with you Kessan... Trust me... I realy do but I have a date!.&quot;** *She says, still shaken about seeing him like this. She didn&#x27;t even had time to prepare.

Kessan tilts his head.* **&quot;A date? With who?&quot;** *He asks confused as his brain went into big brother mode and Kjara just pointed behind him where Kessan could just see how Vian slinked away.* *Kessan stood up and walked over to the door with heavy steps.* **&quot;And where do you think you are going?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">Vian crossed his arms and watched for a moment. He wasn&#x27;t sure this was the intended way to reunite them. He wasn&#x27;t sure how he could have known they didn&#x27;t know they were both here. Either way, a family reunion was probably not the place for him. He sidled back slowly, intent on disappearing.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Kessan follows the light blue dragonborn stoicly and doesn&#x27;t talk much either. He had to know if it was true what he said. That Kjara realy was back. His huge Wings would last for a while and he had a bit of a problem to fit through the hallways a little bit. As they reached the door of Kjaras room his armored fist knocks at the door of the room way gentler then someone would expect with such a heavy piece of equipment.

A few moments pass before the door opens and the redish hued Dragonborn opend the door, only covered by a long towel around her and another one around her head.* **&quot;Yes hello?&quot;** *She said as she just looked at the huge armored chest of her brother before she looked upwards to meet the eyes of her older brother.* **&quot;Kessan?&quot;** *She asked before the silver dragonborn just tackled her in a bearhug as he enters the room with her.*

**&quot;KJARA!&quot;** *He says as he hugs her tightly against his armor, his wings engulfing her as well.

Kjara was... perplexed. That was the last thing she had expected to see this day. Her Brother! She looked over his shoulder as she hugged back and saw Vian. He looked shocked in a way but... It was a good shocked?*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">Vian lead Kessen, without much more to say, to the hall in question. Unless spoken to, he did not speak, simply leading the way for the silver dragonborn. Once in the right location, he gestured to the door next to his own, Kjaras dormitory.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-12</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-15</p> <p class="message">*After waiting another half an hour Kjara gets up and walks to the door. It looked like he wasn&#x27;t comming so she better checked if he was already gone to the guild hall. She opened the door and looked out into the hallway before stepping out and closing the door behind her. Maybe it wasn&#x27;t custom for his people to be curtsy towards woman or mething but she wouldn&#x27;t know. She went over to his door and knocked. Getting no response. She waited for a few minutes before she let out a sigh and made her way down the hallway. She would need to turn back her expectations of Vian a lot it seemed. She wondered what was hiding beneath his hard, serious shell and that wonder for him... Made her feel warm in a bit. She shook her head as she placed another hand on her stomach. Maybe it was better to not get to involved with him. She rubbed her eyes before letting out a sighand made her way to the guild hall.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-15</p> <p class="message">*The next morning, Kjara woke up with cramps in the places where Vian had hit her. She realy wasn&#x27;t accustomed to taking hits like that. She groaned and felt miserable the whole time while she crawled out of the bed, draged herself to the shower and did her best to relax under the warm water. She felt sore just from that one duel and she would have cried over it if this would have been the only time she would take hits and had to feel pain. She had to toughen up if she wanted to be an adventurer. After taking the shower and putting some lovely rose scented parfume onto herself she wrapped herself into a big towel and went over to her walk in dresser and looked over her clothes. She had a little collection of things but she needd something that could get dirty and left her arms free if she was going to learn painting with Vian since she was sure that she would make a mess the first time painting. She chose a long white T-shirt she loves to wear when she felt down and just wanted to crash down on a couch with a good book and a bucket of Ice cream. She wasn&#x27;t sure if she should wear anything fance but given what she knew about Vian, the more casual would be better. She went for some hot pants before she took a thick black headband and bound her scalie dreads into a long ponytail. She loved her orangy scale hair wich went all the way down to the base of her tail even though it gt in the way some times. She wondered if Vian would come to get heror if he would just go on his own, waiting for her. She would just wait for a bit, ma,be he would come.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-15</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-14</p> <p class="message">*Kjara returned the nod.* [Draconic]||**&quot;See you tomorrow then Vian.

Joining this guild wasn&#x27;t so bad afterall! She beamed at the ceiling before placing a hand onto her stomach and the smile stopped. It still stung... A lingering pain where he hit her. In a fight there was no space for hesitation but his moves... None of his strikes had any hesitation or restraint behind them.* **&quot;I&#x27;m in trouble aren&#x27;t I?&quot;** *She asks herself as she clenches her fist over her stomach.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-14</p> <p class="message">Hand on his door, he flicked his eyes at her.

Also it would free her up to do some other things in combat other then just poking people and doing her fancy footwork. But as he said he painted she looked at him stunned.

I would love to learn how to paint!&quot;**|| *She says, her eyes glowing with excitement and wonder, maybe even with a little bit of admiration.
