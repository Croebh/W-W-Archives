Before she followed Aghayon out though, the angel blue Dragonborn picked up the blanket and took a deep sniff of it.. sighing a little after. It smelled like both of their scents mingled together, and it was inexplicably pleasant. Arizys soon drops it after before running out to catch up, and closes the door behind herself.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-15</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Fires cause smoke, and when enough smoke gets high enough it can cause Lightning.&quot;** *He says with a grin ashe opens the door to his room.* **&quot;Just waiting on you Zapps.&quot;** *He says laughing before he walks out into the hallway.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-15</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Batteries exist now, dummy hunk. Lightning and electricity can last a *lot* longer than fires with said technology.&quot;** *Arizys picks up Venixayla too, putting the scabbard with her dear shattered sword sheathed within to her back before strapping it properly.* **&quot;And lightning can cause fires! Fires can&#x27;t do the opposite.&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn winks before softly punching Aghayon&#x27;s shoulder. She herself had minor capabilities for fire as it was a side effect of lightning after all, but likely no where near the other Dragonborn&#x27;s affinity for it.* **&quot;Alright I&#x27;m ready. Let&#x27;s head out?&quot;** *Arizys kicks up her pouch before strapping it by the back of her thigh, keeping it properly attached before looking back to him.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-15</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon just came out of the Bathroom when she pulled up her pants and couldn&#x27;t hide the cheeky smile on his face. She realy was a hot girl and that was hard to deny.* **&quot;Hey, I don&#x27;t play favorites.&quot;** *He says a he closes the bathroom door behind him as he walks over to her to pick up Valasjera and Emberfang.* **&quot;Lightning is quick and bright, but fire lasts and persists longer.&quot;** *He says with a wink.* **&quot;There is a reason people say that passion burns bright.&quot;** *He bleps a little at her while he straps the two blades onto his hips.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-15</p> <p class="message">**&quot;What can I say? Fire&#x27;s just a *lot* slower than lightning.&quot;** *Tiny arcs of lightning and sparks dance over her scaly fingers for a moment in a flashy show.* **&quot;And of course. I&#x27;ve made some cash in arenas and colosseum&#x27;s around before with Venix, and we do *very* well.&quot;** *Arizys nods and rolls her eyes when Aghayon winked at her, shooing him off when he headed towards his bathroom before looking over to her own clothes in a neat little pile. Not wanting to waste time, she hops off the bed immediately after Aghayon closes the door, stripping herself off the soft and comfy satin pajamas which she tossed on to the couch before hastily getting her equipment. The angel blue Dragonborn gets her scale-tight chainmail up, buckling it up quickly behind her before pulling on her pants, then finally her top over it.. though certainly not fast enough so Aghayon could have definitely stolen a peek if he was faster.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-12</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon bleped back at her and smiles as he lies there  comfortable. He loved moments like this and they were far to few in his opinion.* **&quot;I am looking forward to work with you Ari... You were pretty hard to pin down yesterday, not gonna lie.&quot;** *He says as he looked up towards the ceiling.* **&quot;Also looking forward to seeing you in the Arena. I bet you kick some serious ass.&quot;** *He says smiling.* **&quot;But enough sweet talking.&quot;** *He says and sits up before he stretches himself out.* **&quot;Let&#x27;s get dressed and get this show on the road.&quot;** *The black scaled dragonborn got up, just giving her a wink as he climbed over her to get out of the bed before he walks over to his closet to grab some new clothes and his coat before he goes into the bathroom again to change.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-11</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh shut it-&quot;** *Arizys cuts herself off when Aghayon slowly got over her for a moment as he reached for the nightstand on her side. Though her eyes did narrow a little towards the cheeky black Dragonborn trying to get closer to her, the translucent scales of her cheeks reddened for a second before he moved away.* **&quot;Cheeky bastard..&quot;** *Arizys muttered under her breath before putting her mug next to his.* **&quot;Of course I&#x27;m fun. I&#x27;m the best.&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn bleps jokingly, clearly not thinking that, but the soft smile which soon replaced it was so genuine it was obvious she was cheered up a lot by the compliment.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-10</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon chuckles and smirks at.* **&quot;Who knows? Maybe the opposite is true.&quot;** *He says with a wink before he emptys his mug and puts it aside, reaching over Arizys to reach the nightstand next to the bed to put the mug down, coming a bit close to her but he was carefull to not accidentaly knock her mug out of her hand before he lies back down next to her.* **&quot;I am glad your staying though. You are a lot of fun to be around.&quot;** *He says as he gets comfortable again as he crosses his arms behind his head to lie on.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well.. only way to find out really, is to get the rest of her shards right?&quot;** *Arizys held the mug of cool milk while repositioning herself, so she could lean back on the bedhead while sipping the delicious lactose. When Aghayon seemingly shot her a challenge, she just rolled her eyes.* **&quot;Yeah. I&#x27;d go mad if I have to stay another night with you.&quot;** *The angle blue Dragonborn rolled her eyes before shaking her head in jest, chuckling softly a little after before adjusting her satin pajamas slightly as to hide the tattoo that was beginning to peek out of her shoulder.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well yeah... Vala sfferd a lot of memory loss from being shatterd and well... Emberfangs heart is a shard of Valasjera so the shards deffinetly have some parts of their personality in them... I am a bit concerned though... Even though Vala hasn&#x27;t change since she had gotten the last shard back so I wonder if she does when she is whole again..&quot;** *Aghayon says, looking into is black coffee before he takes a sip as well.* **&quot;Sure! Can do that.&quot;** *He says with a smile.* **&quot;We also need to set you up with a room as well! Can&#x27;t have you crash here all the time.&quot;** *He says with a wink as if that was a challenge.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well.. the shards are fragments of our blades&#x27; power and soul even.. so I guess maybe that was a deranged part of Vala&#x27;s personality in that piece? Venix told me being shattered like that doesn&#x27;t only physically split them from the rest of their fragments that represent the blade they are, but also magically splits part of their entire identity.. though that could just be something for him.&quot;** *Arizys was a little hyped up from the coffee, but managed to keep cool still. She took the small jug of milk Aghayon had brought up to add to her coffee earlier, and just poured it into her own cup so she could enjoy the rich creamy dairy.* **&quot;Sure. Maybe give me a tour of the place too? Just because I *know* there&#x27;s something here doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll know how to get there.&quot;** *Siiiiiiiiiiiiips.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-09</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon blepped back and refills his cup before he puts the tray away and climbs to Ari onto the bed and gets a bit comfortable.* **&quot;I hope his shards are a bit more friendly... Last time I found one it wanted to go through my chest by itself for some weird reason.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle.* **&quot;But now its part of Vala again so it&#x27;s all good.&quot;** *The black scaled Dragonborn takes a sip of his coffee and lets out a yawn.* **&quot;Wanna chill a bit more before we do your registration stuff? It goes over pretty quick and by the way... Ever went to a tropical beach before?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-08</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Eh, who knows.. Sleeping with him by my side makes the rolling thunder of rain at night a lot calmer though.&quot;** *Arizys had finally decided to stop eating. She had more than her fill already, and felt extremely full. For now, she just resorted to sipping on the coffee which had begun to cool down already.. but the strong caffeine from the brown liquid was pleasant still.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t feel flattered or something because you popped up, dummy hunk. It means nothing. Nothing!&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn blep-ed again before downing the rest of her coffee.* **&quot;It sure does. Venix comes with many perks indeed.. and I hope to explore and discover more as I find more pieces of him.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-08</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon blinked a little and then looks over to the swords over there.* **&quot;Well thats probably because Venix blocks unpleasent dreams for you.&quot;** *He says and looks at her with a smile.* **&quot;Vala did the same with me when I got her.&quot;** *He casualy explains before he smirks a little.* **&quot;Dreaming of me hm?&quot;** *He asks, reaching over and picking up another slice of cheese and salmon before snacking on them.* **&quot;Having a sentient sword friend has it&#x27;s perks.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-08</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Ah!&quot;** *Arizys chuckles a little after swallowing. Man she was beginning to feel full too.. but she didn&#x27;t want any of the food Aghayon had brought up to go to waste. She got up the remaining sunny side up and put it on a piece of toast, before munching it down quickly!* **&quot;Well.. not really sure.. I used to dream a lot more as a kid, but after getting Venix, they&#x27;ve become rarer and rarer. It&#x27;s why I found it a little odd I&#x27;d get a dream all of a sudden now, especially with you in it, dummy hunk.&quot;** *Arizys blep-ed a little jokingly, before getting her coffee to sip more.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-08</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon chuckled a little and smiled. He got a good feel for her well trained belly when they had cuddled before but he enjoyed the sight a lot too. Ari was pretty sexy he couldn&#x27;t deny that.* **&quot;No I ment How does it come that you not dream much?&quot;** *He says chuckling a little before he emptys his cup and just lies down on the bed next to the tray towards the foot end of the bed. He was pretty much done with actively eating and he felt pretty good right now, reaching with his hand under his bathrobe and rubbing his bellyscales a little.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-08</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Great! Honestly.. I&#x27;m still boggled by how this guild has such great food. Who did you say make these dishes again? I may want to get to learn how to cook in the future. A good diet&#x27;s an important part to getting my physique more muscular after all.&quot;** *She lifts her satin shirt a bit, scratching her abdomen lightly before getting back to eating more and allowing Aghayon to see her lean core better. Arizys notices the black Dragonborn snacking on some cheese too, and decides to get a slice with more smoked salmon.. eating them together and sighing with delight. Maybe she&#x27;d put a hold on that diet plan for now.. all this food was too good!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-08</p> <p class="message">*As if Aghayon was giving a shit about her gracefullness or elegance. He was just happy that she was enjoying herself. The black scaled Dragonborn wasn&#x27;t much different either, eating just mortadella, salamy and cheese slices without the toast.* **&quot;How&#x27;s that?&quot;** *He asks as he reached for a strip of bacon. He was getting more comfortable around Ari and if they weren&#x27;t eating breakfast he would pop out a bag of chips and just do some waterfall and chill on his hamoc with her. He took a sip from his coffee and put a sunny side egg onto a toast and munches on that, smearing some of the liquid yolk over his lips. He was not asking what she dreamt on purpose. If she wanted to talk about her dream she would tell him herself.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-08</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Thanks.&quot;** *Arizys responded a little plainly, but her cheery mood soon returned as she smiled genuinely towards Aghayon. She certainly needed more time to get through her own problems first before she could move on to hearing about others&#x27; experiences.* **&quot;I slept fine, though I had a weird dream.. which is extra odd since I usually don&#x27;t dream that much.&quot;** *Arizys gets a few slices of the smoked salmon, eating them straight just like that.. clearly not exactly caring if Aghayon found her to be graceful or elegant.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon sighs and nods. He was ok with that for now even though he had no problem with sharing thst especialy with someone he actualy started to like* **&quot;Alright... Cheery breakfast it is.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle before looking at her with a smile. She seemed to be a bit unsure of herself when it came to her past, probably because they shared similiar experiences. Aghayon couldn&#x27;t blame her. If her story was similiar to his then she had her own hardships to overcome.* **&quot;So... How was your sleep? Didn&#x27;t get to ask you that earlier with all the confusion.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Pffft, please.. don&#x27;t flatter yourself, dummy hunk.&quot;** *Arizys rolled her eyes while shaking her head, taking a sip of her coffee when he called himself hot. Well.. he was sorta hot.. his body was pretty muscular too- WAIT NO. She kept her gaze when Aghayon began talking about his scar when he noticed her noticing it, but she cuts him off when he takes another sip of his coffee. Maybe it was because she was uncomfortable with her current past of meeting Venixayla still that made her not want to hear more about Aghayon&#x27;s experience yet, but she shot him a glare that was likely sharper than intended.* **&quot;Let&#x27;s not talk about that right now.&quot;** *Arizys pauses for a moment, not meaning to sound so serious. She did want to know more, but now.. when the happy atmosphere was still alive between them, the angel blue Dragonborn wasn&#x27;t sure if she wanted to turn it bitter with their experiences with close scrapes with death.* **&quot;Maybe.. in the future.. but let&#x27;s just have a cheerful breakfast right now?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well the whole world is weird and odd.&quot;** *He says chuckling, just chilling on the bed with her while enjoying his coffee before he just rolls up a slice of mortadella and takes a bite from it just to snack a little.* **&quot;And I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m odd. I&#x27;m nust a chill and hot guy.&quot;** *He says and winks at her as he noticed her look at his pecks. But he became a little mellow when she looked away, probably noticing his scar and he reached up to pull the bathrobe a bit more close to hide it.* **&quot;It&#x27;s from when I met Vala...&quot;** *He said after a while as he looked out of the balkony and takes another sip of his coffee.* **&quot;I was... I was a caravan guard and mercenary before I came here... One of my jobs went pretty south...&quot;** *He said before taking another sip.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">*Arizys was a lot more accustomed to tea, as leaves to make such a drink were much more common than coffee beans, so the small amount of coffee in her system was enough to overcome her hangover and wake her up more.* **&quot;Sounds good, though I&#x27;ll probably have to take a quest or something here first to get more money.&quot;** *She wolfs down the little pile of eggs of two types over buttered toast, munching down very ungracefully, but she looked like she enjoyed every second of it! The food was good after all. The angel blue Dragonborn would very noticeably take a look when she noticed his robe parting a little more, though her gaze was hastily drawn away again when she noticed the massive scar. Not something she wanted to bring up on a good day really, and she decided to just roll her eyes at his low growl.* **&quot;This guild.. is so odd.. just like you, dummy hunk.&quot;** *She chuckles a little, though the idea of fighting against strange waves of monsters was indeed fun.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I know what you mean.&quot;** *He says, scarfing down some more eggs before refilling his and her coffee, him having reached a state where he could ctualy function properly for the day.* **&quot;During my last Quest I wore half plate most of the time and it was realy hard to get my Coat over it since it wasn&#x27;t realy made for me. If you need new Armor though, Ethen, one of the Guilds Leaders or my buddy Kessan can hook you up wit new armor if you need it.&quot;** *He said, leaning back on the bed a little with the cup in hand. His bathrob shifted a little, revealing more of his broad chest and well trained pectorals while also showing off a part of the big scarr just over his heart. Her flexing was obviously checked out and he couldn&#x27;t supress a affirming growl from the male dragonborn across from her.* **&quot;Well it&#x27;s pretty good to gaige what you can and what you can&#x27;t do. We have all kinds of people in the Guild to train with. Also Grax sometimes organises fights against Monsters to train teamwork wich are realy fun most of the time... Well, if it isn&#x27;t actualy an attempt to attack the guild or otherworldy invasion.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle before taking another sip.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hm.. I&#x27;ll probably visit the workshop in the future. I need to get myself some better armour soon, after all. Chain is fine and all, but I&#x27;m looking towards Splint, or maybe even Plate. Will probably have to work out a bit more to get used to such heavy armour under my clothing though.&quot;** *She flexes her bicep for Aghayon, and it was surprisingly decent! When she wasn&#x27;t flexing, she merely looked lean and athletic.. so this display of her relatively decent muscles would be slightly unexpected.* **&quot;Arena.. could work out there I suppose, and maybe learn more about Venix&#x27;s past if the library has books about sentient swords like him.* *She gets another piece of toast and does the same, slathering it with butter before putting another sunny side up on it.. but then piled on some more scrambled eggs on top too!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">(Or an omlette...)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">(I want scrambled eggs so bad now...)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">*A soft chuckle comes from him as he gets a little more comfortable while eating. The two of them would have a lot of fun together and he was sure of it.* **&quot;Well we have a few shops and workshops in the guild so people can make and maintain their equipment and magic stuff, we have  a big temple for those who worship.&quot;** *He says while buttering another slice of toast. Now that they were eating he realy worked up an appetite.* **&quot;We also have a big arena for sparring and training between Guild Members. Other then that, most of the space are the living quarters... oh and we have a big and suprisingly comfy library a few stories up.&quot;** *He says before taking a sip of his coffee. He noticed her cheeks flashing for a moment and he just kept smiling.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Mhm! Just Vala! Don&#x27;t get some weird ideas, dummy hunk! I&#x27;m not staying here because I&#x27;m interested in you at all or something stupid like that!&quot;** *The soft translucent angel blue scales of her cheeks flared up for a second, before returning to their original hue as she returns her attention back to the food.

The other thing she had seen was the vaguely greatsword blade shaped scar that went straight through the middle of his back, just where his heart would have been. Another sigh came from him as he finished up his shower and started to dry himself off with a towel before grabbing a bigger towel he wrapped around his waist before putting on a fluffy and red bathrobe before walking to the door. He had calmed down enough for not pitching a tent anymore before he took a deep breath before walking out.* **&quot;Sorry...&quot;** *He said, not looking at her and rather focused on the open balkony and the rising sun.* **&quot;Didn&#x27;t want you to see that... something we guys have to deal with in the morning...&quot;** *As if Ari hadn&#x27;t had anything to do with it.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-05</p> <p class="message">*Arizys hadn&#x27;t seen the look of shame or embarrassment on the other Dragonborn&#x27;s face, having been looking the other way as he got up to go to the bathroom. When she had finally heard satin clothes hit the floor and the shower turn on, she let out a breath she hadn&#x27;t known she was holding. That.. was interesting.. for lack of a better word. The angel blue Dragonborn didn&#x27;t know what to say after feeling the large bulge behind her and realised what it was, her cheeks burning more as she tried to purge her mind of it. At least Aghayon&#x27;s musk wafting out the shower was helping a little, and that got her to realise that the door wasn&#x27;t closed properly. Arizys walks up to it, but catches the sliver of a glimpse of the black Dragonborn showering within, causing her to yelp before she slams the door shut properly.* **&quot;I WASN&#x27;T PEEKING!&quot;** *She yelled out in a tone which certainly made it sound like she was, before Arizys finally hopped back on to the bed and buried her face in a pillow.. Aghayon&#x27;s by accident, which let her drown in his scent.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-05</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon gulped and feared what Ari would do once she straddled him. It was a realy close call and he closed his eyes when she shifted downwards. Once she climbed off, he stood up from the bed and with an ashamed look just walked into the bathroom, not even closing the door right, leaving it open just a little. He got out of his pajamas and a short time after the sound of discarded satin clothes the sound of the shower was able to be heared. It took a few moments but then the enticing smell of leather and lavendel whaft out of the bathroom as he started to cover his scales in his favorite brand of scale treatment products. The morning had started great but this was... pretty awkward and Aghayon didn&#x27;t realy felt well about this. He let out a deep sigh and just rested his head against the tiled wall inside the big shower.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hah!

Well I can do it anytime anyway-&quot;** *That was when the angel blue Dragonborn had shifted back a bit, and her rear had perfectly line up to grind against a hard tent on Aghayon&#x27;s lap. She immediately cut herself off, turning around before finally realising what she was looking at through the cloud of her drowsiness and hangover.* **&quot;Oh- wha- n-..&quot;** *Arizys immediately hops off the other Dragonborn, standing up and looking away before pointing at the bathroom.. gesturing for him to go do whatever he needed to do while her cheeks flared up with a deep red.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-05</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon tried to resist  but appearantly Ari&#x27;s hangover gave her super strenght and he was pulled back onto the bed. A yelp of suprise presided his fall as he landed before he just loked away from her because there was no hiding the tent he was sporting.

As he stands up, she approaches him, scaly brow raised in challenge and curiosity.* **&quot;Hey! You&#x27;re not escaping that easily, dummy hunk.&quot;** *The angel blue Dragonborn quickly rushed up behind Aghayon, both her arms wrapping around one of his to pull him back. Her head still hurt so she may have not been in proper control of her strength, but she kept trying to see what he was hiding!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-04</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon sat there for a moment frozen.

G&#x27;morning dummy hunk.&quot;** *Arizys did stay on the floor for a bit, slightly captivated by the gaze Aghayon pierced hers with despite the lack of flair within them. It was an odd feeling to be looked at like that, but the angel blue Dragonborn brushed it aside for now. As the black Dragonborn shifted back a bit, Arizys slowly got up from the floor, her tail slowly unwinding around her lithe leg before picking up the blanket.* **&quot;Neither, dummy hunk.&quot;** *She rolled her eyes when Aghayon suggested they get back into bed, shaking her head a little too. Did she regret cuddling with him to sleep? Her aching mind couldn&#x27;t give her a proper answer yet, but despite the hangover, she couldn&#x27;t think of any reason why she&#x27;d regret it. It was enjoyable after all.* **&quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot;** *Arizys tilted her head a little when she noticed the strange way Aghayon was positioned on the bed, and had took a few steps around the bed after tossing the blanket back on the bed before noticing the tent and pointing at it. She&#x27;d know what it was if her head wasn&#x27;t aching right now, but Arizys hid it behind a calm face and just remained pointing at the strange pitched tent there.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-04</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon smiled at her and let out a little chuckle before he looked at her with a warm look. It was interesting that his white eyes could look that warmly at someone when they were of thst cold color.* **&quot;Good morning to you too Arizys&quot;** *He said still smiling as he looked over her, noticing how her tail coiled around her leg as a sign of defense but also of emberrasment. He didn&#x27;t pointed it out in respect for her before he slid around on the bed until he was back on the place where the two had slept. he turned his back to her and then placed a leg strategicly angled to hide the tent he was pitching.* **&quot;Want to get into the bed again for some more comfort before actualy getting up or do you want to stay on the floor?&quot;** *He asked a bit teasing.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-04</p> <p class="message">*The kick was more out of reflex than intending to hurt the black Dragonborn. She felt trapped in that moment, held so tightly in a hold she was not familiar with. Though it was warm and the sense of security was exuded from the muscular frame behind her earlier, it was instinct to kick herself out of a restraint. Arizys didn&#x27;t hit the table or chair fortunately, landing not so gracefully on the floor instead while strewn in the warm blanket. She rubbed her eyes a little first, groggy mind still trying to understand where she was, before it pounded in her head. Her very first hangover, paired with confusion that came with waking up in an unfamiliar place. When she saw Aghayon though, it all came flooding back, and her tail slowly coiled back around her leg as the jewellery on her horns jingled.* **&quot;Oh.. it&#x27;s just you, dummy hunk.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-04</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon jolts as she suddendly wakes up, barely dodging the kick and raising his arm defensively* **&quot;Wow! Watch out!&quot;** *He says blinking before he lies down onto his belly, not only to hide a rather emberrasing sight but also to look after her if she was ok!* **&quot;You&#x27;re alright?&quot;** *He asked with a honestl, concerned tone. There was a small table next to the bed where she had laid before and he didn&#x27;t want her to hurt her on the Table or the Chair. He hadn&#x27;t thought she would overreact like that! He had thought she would slap him or something but kick at him? That was a new one! His tail was swinging behind him over the bed and he hoped he didn&#x27;t went to far... But then again it was partialy her fault and he was sure thst she would not accept any acusation on any of that.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-04</p> <p class="message">*Arizys stirred in her sleep a little more, the sun&#x27;s rays on her face getting her internal clock ahead more. A soft mewl escaped her as Aghayon teased her more, the warmth grazing her rear and bosom making her more comfortable yet the movements he was making lightened her sleep further.* **&quot;Shut up, dummy hunk.. I don&#x27;t want you, stupid.. Even though you&#x27;re handsome.. and kind.. and-&quot;** *Arizys&#x27; eyelids shot open all of a sudden, her azure irises taking a moment to adjust to the brightness of the room. A cough and clearing of throat later, she suddenly notices the position she was in with his forearm between her mounds and lap grinding against her rear.* **&quot;What the fu-&quot;** *Arizys immediately pushed Aghayon&#x27;s forearm out of her hold, turning around to kick at him.

He was able to hear them clearly with how close he was to her and it put a smile on his face. Though he also noticed that her sleep wqs becoming a bit lighter and this was a good opportunity to do a little bit of teasing himself. He moved his arm just a little bit down as she hugged it between her soft bosom to brush it just a little mit more against the soft mounds before he put his muzzle next to her ear.* **&quot;What if it is not a dream.&quot;** *He whisperd in a slight growling and deep enticing voice.* **&quot;What if you want that...&quot;** *He whisperd again as he became so bold as to push a bit more against her. Not only giving her the warmth she so desire but also to put a little bit more soft weight onto her to make her feel deeply embraced.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*The warm breath washing over the scales of her exposed and inked neck let her drown in more of his scent, the musk of the masculine Dragonborn embracing her blanketing her senses quite a bit as the morning rays began to lighten her sleep slightly. As she stirred softly in her sleep, she continued to grind back at Aghayon, not realising what she was doing really as her body just wanted heat.. and the friction and pressing up against his chest was giving her exactly that!* **&quot;Dummy hunk.. get outta my dreams..&quot;** *Arizys murmured out a little before getting back to snoring softly, her arms clutching on to the black Dragonborn&#x27;s hand between her bosom a little tighter as she buried her face in his hand.. nuzzling his palm softly which only made her drown in more of his scent.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*The black scaled dragonborn certainly bit his lip as he grinded back against him. It was a bit unexpected of her doing it but the effect was the same. Aghayon let out a low groan as she brushed back against what he tried to hide from her and he had to admit, he enjoyed it more then he should. Aghayon closed his eyes and tried to figure out what he should do... Give into his touch starved desires or should he get up and risking of waking her up and make her angry and or upset by doing so. On the other hand he didn&#x27;t want her to think that he was a pervert and he certainly wanted to take a cold shower right now. In the end though, he just stayed where he was, even coming a little closer while his hot breath washed over her neck as he nuzzled his head against hers, pushing back at her for more contact. He would deal with the consequences butvfor now he would just enjoy all this until he couldn&#x27;t take itnanymorebore Ari waking up.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*The deep sleeper seemed to shift along with Aghayon&#x27;s movements, her subconscious mind and unconscious body not exactly happy that her source of warmth was moving away. She&#x27;d turn a little in her sleep, turning ever so slightly in the direction of Aghayon.. and along moved the rest of her body. Her arms were still hugging on to his muscular forearm, but her hip was stuck back as she snuggled backwards back into him.. lean yet firm back pressed back against his strong pectorals as one of her legs suddenly moved out to lay over him. Her decent athletic yet gentle rear was grinding against his lap too, definitely creating an.. incident.. of sorts. Arizys was still sleeping soundly though, and if Aghayon moved her off of him now she&#x27;d definitely wake up.. but she looked so at peace grinding her back and rear up to his warm body!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon noticed the tattoo but averted his eyes. It eould have been a good time to get a better look at it but even in his half awake state he knew this was nothing he should see even though it lookec actualy pretty cool. It must have a very bad meaning for her being so protective of it so he instead just snuggled up closer so he didn&#x27;t had to look at it. The black scaled dragonborn let out another soft growl as she pushed back more and cuddled against him more. This was nice and he could imagine doing this a whole lot more with her. He deeply hoped Arizys would stay at the Guikd a while longer then just today, maybe even join. It would be... realy nice if he was honest. Aghayon let out a little sigh as he shuffled his other arm around a little until he could rest his head on his upper arm and just enjoyed the cuddling some more while his thumb ran over her soft and thin cheek scales. Aghayon nuzzled his snout into the crook of her neck again, trying to get as much cuddling in a spossibke before she would inevitably wake up to sate his touch starved heart. She was such a beautiful girl he thought as he looked her over softly even though the oversized pajamas hid most of her form but he could feel her well trained back on his chest and belly and her well rounded and firm butt rubbing against his lap whike they were so close. The black scaled dragonborn bit his lips a little though as he turned his hips away from her a little to not create any... incidents.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*From his position and due to her light shifting in her sleep, her satin pajamas had slipped off her shoulder a little more due to it being oversized. Aghayon would be able to see the top third of her tattoo in all its glory now. The dark ink was a mural of arcs of lightning and some flowers, and the black Dragonborn would be able to notice the top part where the depictions of blooming freesia flowers with arcs and jolts of electricity ended at her neck. At the centre of it all was a wilted freesia though, but drawn in a way which made it look like lightning was coming out of it. It likely covered the entirety of her shoulder blade and went lower by the scale of the inking he could see. Even as Aghayon kissed her neck or grazed her cheek, which had extremely thin and soft scales, Arizys didn&#x27;t wake up. She was likely a heavy sleeper, and the gesture only made her cuddle up to his arm and chest more.. snuggling in to get more heat as her adorable soft snores continued.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*Aghayons sleep was very deep and with Arizys own warmth against him it was very peacefull as well. He didn&#x27;t even turned once in his sleep and just enjoyed the warm feeling of the cute and athletic dragonborn cuddled against him. The sunlight that was creeping into the room made his pet Wigglers raise their head out of their pots as they greeted the morning sun while Aghayon just hekd Ari as close as before, with her nuzzled hp even closer then before. The black scaled dragonborn wrinkled his nose a little as their mingled scent reached his nostrills and he slowly opend his eyes, the soft drum of a very mild hangover poking at his brain. He didn&#x27;t stirr to much as he slowly woke up but the feeling of is arm between her soft mounds and her hugging it tightly made him let out a deep and low rumbke from his chest. This was nice and a little bit closer then he had anticipated for her to come. He placed his muzzle softly on her neck, taking in more of her delightfull mountainous scent while his tail softly reach around him and placed itself next to hers. It was just so comfortable with her laying like this. In his sleepy mind that was still groggy from waking up he didn&#x27;t realy think right as he softly ran his palm over her sleeping cheek to let her rest on the warm hand before he planted his soft and smooth lips on her neck, planting a very soft kiss on them without even thinking about it.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*As rays of sunlight streamed through Aghayon&#x27;s room, and eventually crawled to illuminate the sleeping Dragonborns, Arizys stirred in her sleep a little. Through the night, Arizys had snuggled up as close to Aghayon as she could, and the arm he had around her waist had become a mini body pillow she was now hugging tightly. It was a cold night after all, and though the blanket was warm, the black Dragonborn was warmer. His muscular arm was now bent at the elbow around her midriff, forearm between her bosom as his strong hand rested under her chin for her to snuggle up to. Her lithe arms were wrapped around his forearm, embracing it to keep it there as almost inaudible snores slowly escaped her with each exhale she took. She looked extremely at peace now that she was asleep. Usually, a challenging or competitive smile or scowl of sorts would dominate her expression, but now that she was completely relaxed, her cute relaxed face was almost angelic with the radiant streaks of sunlight illuminating it slightly.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*Arizys had fallen into a deep slumber already when Aghayon promised his wrath on top of all else if her blade were to be stolen. Her subconscious self snuggled back up against him more even as he scooted closer, making it so her back was essentially entirely pressed up against his muscular frame as she dozed off. Maybe it was his warmth, or his pleasant musk, or the sense of security her mind felt when near him that subconsciously brought her closer to him. Either way, sleep claimed her consciousness in a bit, and soon.. dreams entered her mind as the night slipped away, with the two Dragonborn cuddled up snugly with each other.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Don&#x27;t worry...&quot;** *He says softly and nuzzles his snout into her neck, taking in ner scent some more while holding her softly but close against his warm and muscular chest.* **&quot;No one will try and steal from you...

Yes, he wanted to be on her good side because Ari had awakend something inside of him he hadn&#x27;t felt often since he had joined the Guild. The only other woman that made him feel this way for completely different reasons was Zyrka but he doubted thst he and her ever got closer then what they already were. Aghayon shuffled just a little bit around before he was comfortable against her, his snout resting in the crook of her neck before he actualy slipped into a well deserved slumber. He was looking forward to what the next day would bring.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*Arizys&#x27; tail had coiled around her leg when they had gotten super close and pressed up against one another, both to make space and her body subconsciously showing anxiety. The angel blue Dragonborn didn&#x27;t complain as Aghayon held on to her tighter while they were slowly shifted under the blanket, covering her in yet another whiff of the black Dragonborn&#x27;s scent. Hers would likely begin to cling on to the sheets and Aghayon&#x27;s pajamas too.* **&quot;Unless this place tries to steal Venix from me, you won&#x27;t have to worry about that.&quot;** *Her voice was a little more than a hushed tone. Arizys&#x27; tiredness got her to speak more quietly, and she mewled softly when Aghayon&#x27;s sigh tickled her neck.* **&quot;Yeah yeah.. Good night, you dummy hunk.. have a sweet dream too..&quot;** *She was mumbling most of it except for the dummy hunk part. Arizys preferred to call him that rather than his entire name or Aggy or something else, and she said it in a more and more endearing way each time. She rested her head on the pillow too, barely an inch away from Aghayon&#x27;s snout so he could constantly get her scent if he wished.. and soon, would slowly slip into slumber.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">*That comment pulled Aghayon out of his inner turmoil and made him smile as he carefully began to tug the two of them in with the help of his tail. They had to shuffle around a little but in the end the two of them were safly and comfortably united beneath the warm blanket on Aghayons bed.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t worry Ari... I doubt I would ever be rough to you... Unless you start rampaging in the Guild then I need to but thats a given.&quot;** *He says soft at first but his tone turned into a more humerous one pretty quickly. He let out a soft sigh before nuzzling up to her a littoe bit more, trying to make her all warm and comfortable before he closes his eyes and rests his head on a pillow.* **&quot;I wish you a good night Arizys... And beautiful dreams.&quot;** *He says as cliché and soft as he could but in the same turn actualy ment it. Aghayon rarely spoke just hollow words or phrases just to say something. Complimentsbthe black scaled dragonborn said were always genuine.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh.. shut it you..&quot;** *The exhaustion from venturing from place to place, and the chase from earlier truly was setting in. Maybe it was sleepiness from eating such a big meal not too long ago too, paired with the drowsiness set upon her mind due to the calming warmth of the alcohol in her. Arizys didn&#x27;t complain as he brought her up a little and closer to him. The angel blue Dragonborn was oblivious to Aghayon&#x27;s inner turmoil, and would likely remain that way for the rest of the night as she was going to stay facing away. Now that they were this close though, Arizys&#x27; rhythmic heartbeat could be heard by the black Dragonborn, a steady bump that seemed to mimic his own. Not knowing about Aghayon&#x27;s doubts, she made a little comment when he saw his hand clench harder into a fist.* **&quot;Hunk if you grab me that roughly when we sleep I&#x27;m gonna jab your ribs again, ya hear me?&quot;** *She giggled a little and pat his forearm softly.. tracing the soft scales of her palm over his muscular forearm.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon smiled and then just did that, Pulling her up towards him and holding her close to his chest while doing so. He could feel her sacking down a little as she became more tired from the alcohol and probably their little chase from earlier. He could use some rest himself after haing a duel with Charm and their chase and he was glad the day wouldxend like this with her in his arms and not her sleeping in the woods.* **&quot;Or you just let me scoot you.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle as he held her a bit closer then before, a little bit out of fear of her suddendly changing her mind about them sleeping together in one bed. Aghayon then became silent again though after that. She was warming up to him he could tell but... There were the doubts again... The same doubts he had when he talked with Zyrka... Should he get this attached to Arizys? He hated this side of his but his Ex had made him this way... He couldn&#x27;t even trust his own feelings anymore. Ari could feel his fist clench in front of her a little but otherwise he didn&#x27;t change much.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*She didn&#x27;t respond to him asking if she wanted him to stop. In all honesty, Arizys was glad that he had the energy to constantly challenge and one-up her as most she&#x27;s met in her life so far had preferred to distance themselves away from her in fear of not being able to keep up. The Dragonborn understood their reasoning, but that didn&#x27;t make her any less lonely. She still did have friends, but Aghayon was the first to match her bravado, and she enjoyed every second of it even though she showed annoyance at it. Arizys didn&#x27;t say anything now when his muscular arm slowly closed up to her waist again, rolling her eyes a little when he chuckled again.* **&quot;It&#x27;d be a lot easier to scoot if you weren&#x27;t holding me like this, ya dummy perv hunk.&quot;** *More sarcasm, and a part of her secretly wanted him to pull her up himself as she was getting tired. The alcohol was slowing her mind, and now that she was so comfy, she realised how tired she actually was.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon smiles softly as he looked at her. The jab made him whince just a little but afterwards he just slid back into the same position with his chest against her back.* **&quot;I told you that I can stop if you want to.&quot;** *He says softly as he slowly pulls his arm again around her waist. It became a little bit appearant that he was enjoying this cuddling way more then he probably should but her little compliment made him just bold enough to embrace her slightly again. Aghayon just laid there for a while without saying anything before he actualy let go of her and pushed himself up again to look down at her. The two of them were lying right in the middle of the bed and he doubted they could sleep like that  comfortably at all especialy with them laying on the blanket.* **&quot;Speaking of sleep, We should scoot up a little so we can get under the sheets.&quot;** *He says chuckling.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Arizys just mewled softly when he further reaffirmed that he enjoyed her scent.* **&quot;I.. like yours too.&quot;** *The angel blue admitted as well, the alcohol not making her second doubt giving Aghayon a compliment. She did indeed like the way he smelled though, and took another sniff of his musk still clinging on to the sheets. The beating of his heart right behind hers made her pause for a moment, her gaze shot out the window with the starry heavens before them before she glances back. Arizys was about to call out and tease the cheesy shit he just said, but when he poked more fun at her.. she jabbed her elbow back, hitting his ribs a little lightly though his firm pectorals would likely absorb the blow.* **&quot;Little bugger.. I&#x27;m never gonna be able to sleep with you constantly being a pain in the ass!&quot;** *She shot back sarcastically, but didn&#x27;t deny that she was smiling indeed.. the broad grin brazen on her face.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I realy like it.&quot;** *He says as he takes another breath of her scent as he nuzzled her neck softly with his muzzle. The jingling of her jewelery made him smile softly. Her jab at him giving her compliments was accompanied with a chuckke that rolled through his toned chest she was leaning against while she could feel his strong heart beating through it* **&quot;As many as you want Ari.&quot;** *He says in a very soft tone. Sure he wanted to be on her good side! Why wouldn&#x27;t he when he finaly found someone who could keep up with him when it came to stile, strenght and wittyness.* **&quot;But I can stop if you want so you don&#x27;t need to cramp up your snout while hiding that smile of yours.&quot;** *He said after he had put his muzzle on her shoulder as he nuzzled his head against hers.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*It wasn&#x27;t that she disliked Aghayon&#x27;s touch, but rather felt a strange feeling in the pit of her stomach.. almost like butterflies when he hugged her. Arizys wasn&#x27;t sure what it was really, not able to comprehend this feeling as she had no experience with before. She didn&#x27;t stop the black Dragonborn from nuzzling the back of her neck though, and she was trying to best to hide her genuine smile when Aghayon complimented the jewellery decorating her horns too.* **&quot;Jeez.. how many compliments are you gonna give me to get on my good side, dummy hunk..&quot;** *Arizys shook her head a little, subconsciously inching back a tiny bit so her back could lean against his firm chest lightly.* **&quot;A relatively new brand from Waterdeep.. from a niche vendor. Found it because it was cheap, but it was surprisingly good so I kept using it.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon just smiled and chuckled softly at her words. She was hard to get thst was for sure but he didn&#x27;t mind it in any way shape or form. This was probably the first time she was this close to another man in her entire life so he wouldn&#x27;t be to much of an anoyance. When she tugged his arm a little away from her he was a bit disapointed though. It wasn&#x27;t far and he was sure that sooner or later while sleeping he would be holding her again.* **&quot;That is fair... It&#x27;s nice as well and suits your scales.&quot;** *He said as a genuine compliment especialy since he enjoyed it when it ringed a little whenever she moved her head. She could see it but Aghayon had a very happy smile on his face right now since he was surely a little bit touch starved and spooning here like this with Arizys was very nice.* **&quot;Also you need to tell me what soap you are using... It smells realy nice.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Enough out of you.. friggin&#x27; hunks.. always doing these kinda things..&quot;** *Arizys puffed up her cheeks while slightly annoyed. It wasn&#x27;t a bad annoyance though, as she herself enjoyed the back and forth banter which was happening between them the majority of the time. When she felt the satin of her top being pulled, she was ready to whip around and slap him, but as it fell back on to her inked scales, she held herself back and realised what he was doing. The angel blue Dragonborn didn&#x27;t say much about it.. instead yelping when she suddenly felt Aghayon coming up behind her with his warm chest up against her back and the arm wrapped around her waist. Arizys would be lying if she said being surrounded in this warmth wasn&#x27;t pleasant though.* **&quot;I do.. I find it annoying to have to take it off and put it back on everyday, so I just leave it all on.&quot;** *She said a little plainly before her hand reached Aghayon&#x27;s wrist to pull his hand sliiiightly away, but mostly still letting him spoon her from behind.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon smiled at her warmly when she turned around all red on her cheeks and chuckled softly. She was realy cute he had to admit and quite a looker herself.* **&quot;Is it realy so bad if someone wants you to feel liked?&quot;** *He asked softly before she could feel him shuffle a bit forward before she could feel him tugging the pajamas up a little to cover up her tattoo. She was very self concious about it so he didn&#x27;t want her to feel bad again. Shortly after that she could feel how his muscular chest brushed against her back and his strong arm reach around her as he nuzzled up to her and placed his arm in front of her.* **&quot;By the way... Do you sleep with all that jewelery on?&quot;** *He asks as he looked over her head, seeing all the intricate golden chains and rings over her horns.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Her cheek scales reddened again as he complimented her after bringing her hand back to his chest. With a light tug, Arizys got her hand out of his hold, and averted her gaze.* **&quot;&#x27;Oh shut it you.. constantly trying to get on my good side..&quot;** *She had likely rolled her eyes more times today than ever in her life, and the record would keep racking up.* **&quot;I&#x27;m not checking you out- ugh.. fine! You can be big spoon alright!?&quot;** *And there she cracked.. using the cuddling as a facade so she didn&#x27;t need to admit that he had caught her very red-handed. Arizys just flipped around, turning her back to Aghayon.. and her satin pajamas settled a little and allowed him to get another peek of the tattoo that crept up the back of her neck ever so slightly.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*As Ari was pulling away from his chest, Aghayon reached up and tried to take her small and slender hand into his to put it back onto his chest as he looked at her with a soft smirk.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about being a hunk when you are a hotty instead.&quot;** *He says with a wink before he laughes a little before averting his eyes before looking at the blanket bekow the two. He was certainly aware of her checking him out. In fact, he was very much enjoying it.* **&quot;Also I don&#x27;t mind if you are checking me out.

Am. Not!&quot;** *She sounded a tad irritated, but in a cute tsundere way. Besides, she definitely still was checking him out. Arizys eyes trailed along his pectorals more, admiring the scales on them before looking up a bit to ogle his pronouncee collarbone and jawline as well.* **And no thanks, hot head. I don&#x27;t wanna be a dummy hunk!&quot;** *She jabbed a finger into his chest. Arizys had thankfully manicured her claws so it didn&#x27;t hurt, but she was secretly trying to feel how firm his chest was. Her eyes soon met up with his, and within them was sly cheekiness as she thought she was being discreet! Aghayon totally didn&#x27;t know that she was checking him out right? Maybe she was indeed crushing on him, but the feeling was too foreign for it to really register. For now, Arizys just stared back at him.. digging her finger a little more into his chest before finally retracting her hand. Dang he had a nice chest..*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*The black scaled dragonborn smile widend a bit.* **&quot;Then why are you checking out my pecks huh?&quot;** *He asks her with a bit of bite in his tone wich was just ment in fun. He didn&#x27;t want to insukt her afterall but this back and forth was realy fun.* **&quot;And I think were pretty alike you and me.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle as he looks at her, keeping an eye out on her eyes to see where they ere going.* **&quot;We&#x27;re both strong, tough, good lookin, and have talking swords!&quot;** *He says with a snirk.* **&quot;And a pretty competitive spirit. So what if there are some more similiarities hm?&quot;** *He says as he rests the hand he used to unbutton parts of his top on his hip. It was to soon to make any more moves for Aghayon but he had to say, Ari was realy something else even though he would nit admit thst just yet in the open. He just wanted to see if he could get her to crush on him before he would make any move or not.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*She did her best not to glance back down when she saw Aghayon&#x27;s hand make a move to unbutton another button of his top, but her will was only so stront! Arizys stole another peek of his defined pectorals, definitely a little impressed with his body but quickly gazing back up to meet his gaze.* **&quot;Whaddya talkin&#x27; about, dummy pervy hunk! I&#x27;m not like you.. thinking about.. dumb things like that.. Jeez!&quot;** *She hadn&#x27;t thought about that, but she certainly wouldn&#x27;t mind copping a feel of his chest now if they were going yo cuddle. Arizys still kept her brave front though, despite the fact it was visibly wavering a little more now. Her dumb bravado and innocence kept her pushing back though.. and it was clear both would keep trying to one-up the other until one inevitably cracked, but it would likely be Arizys.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon&#x27;s smile widend a little bit as he sees her eyes dart at what he was hiding under his satin top. He woukdn&#x27;t unbutton all of it but when he saw her falter a little bit he unbuttoned another one for her enjoyment. Despite his scales, Aghayon surely had some good muscular definition hiding under his close and he wonderd if she would like what she was seeing.* **&quot;Well, if you don&#x27;t want to check them out then why are you so insisting of being the big spoon where you would get free access to them hm?&quot;** *He asked as he leaned in just a little bit more while having his confident smile on his lips. Sure he was pushing his luck but then again Ari was pushing against him with her bravado and spunk. The black scaled dragonborn had to admit, he loved every little second of their little back and forth.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Arizys giggled a little as he winced, though she hoped she hadn&#x27;t hurt him as that wasn&#x27;t her intent after all.

Was he secretly swole as fuck under those pajamas!?* **&quot;Oh shush you-&quot;** *She cut herself off when he suddenly got closer again, but the angel blue Dragonborn remained unfaltering as she stared back in his fiery gaze with her own sparking one.* **&quot;Friggin&#x27; dummy hunks.. being dummy pervy.. Just be the small spoon!&quot;** *Aghayon would definitely catch her eyes taking a few glances down to catch peeks of his muscular pectorals when the he unbuttoned the top, and Arizys would certainly peek a few more times before staring back at him challengingly.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon whinced a little when she jabbed at his abdomen and rubbed it just for a moment.* **&quot;Hey! If you punch me stay above the belt line please!&quot;** *He says before he shakes his head.* **&quot;And If I would be so drunk to be pervy then you would know it. I&#x27;m a bit tipsy but not drunk!&quot;** *He says with a chuckle and shakes his head. When she said she never would check him out he just smirked before he truned towards her again as he propoed himself up as he leaned forward a little, closing the distance.* **&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot;** *He asks and unbottuns the first button of the top of his pajamas, giving her a tease of his muscular chest beneath.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*She kept her scaly brow up in defiance even when Aghayon scooted closer to her, both her ego and alcohol coursing through her veins making her not willing to back down as he tried to intimidate her with his larger size in their proximity. Her inexperience likely gave her an extra kick of bravado too as she knew not what the implications or connotations which may come off this are, hence had nothing to fear. When Aghayon challenged her though, she faltered for a moment.. a little surprised at his admission but quiclly bringing her brave face back.* **&quot;Pffffft.. dummy hunk is also a perv while drunk, huh?&quot;** *Arizys giggled a little before shaking her head. Now it was her turn to prop herself up with her shoulder as Aghayon did earlier when he laid on his back.. rolling her eyes a little more when he teased her.* **&quot;Please.. anyone can be the big spoon, hunk. Just cuz I&#x27;m short doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t be it!&quot;** *She retorted a little sarcastically before giving his abdomen a jab.* **And you wish, dummy hunk.

It was an acqusation that was not wrong and he could use it here to throw her of balance a bit. He sooted a little bit closer and propped himself up to look down at her with a warm smile befor he leaned actualy closer and smirked.* **&quot;What if I do?&quot;** *He said to her question about him laying his hands on her. If she never had a boyfriend just by virtue of her home village being of the smaller variety then she should not be familiar with someone who could meet her dominant stance that all Drsgonborn had in them in some capacity.* **&quot;And I think you&#x27;re missing a little hight to be the big spoon.&quot;** *He says with a wink at her just to tease her a bit before he throws hiself onto his back and crosses his arms behind his head and looks at the ceiling.* **&quot;And you just want to check out my pecks&quot;** *He shoots back with a chuckle.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*She broke out into a grin when Aghayon seemed unsure about it. Arizys had challenged him, and he didn&#x27;t seem to be immediately able to challenge her back! Her tongue stuck out for a moment as he took some time to ponder over her proposition, and she was about to tease him more before he finally answered.* **&quot;Cuddling? Really?&quot;** *Arizys rolled her eyes at the black Dragonborn a little while shaking her head, then took a few moments to actually consider it. Well, it was indeed getting a little cold in his room as it got later.. and the warm feeling inside her stomach didn&#x27;t warm up the rest of her. Sharing body heat was a normal thing in desperate situations, and though this wasn&#x27;t one of said situations, it was super fine.. right?* **&quot;You just wanna lay your hands on me, don&#x27;t ya you dummy hunk?&quot;** *Arizys snorted a little before chuckling a little boisterously, laughing cutely before she flicked his nose yet again!* **&quot;I don&#x27;t move around much! I&#x27;ll agree to cuddle on one condition. I&#x27;ll be the big spoon.&quot;** *Another challenge to put her in a dominant position.. even though she likely didn&#x27;t have enough experience to be the dominant one here.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon lifted a brow at her as she laid out her condition and his expression changed a bit. There was a bit of conflict inside of him and he looked away for a moment as he shifted around a little bit as he pulled himself a bit more onto the bed, lying on one of his arms. He was unsure about that proposal and if it was a good Idea as well. He was unsure if that wasn&#x27;t the Alcohol speaking for her or if it was just her own bravado and ego that mad her talk like this. The black dragonborn was clearly hesitant even though his Bed was certainly big enough for two if not more.* **&quot;I... Hmm...&quot;** *He wasn&#x27;t realy sure how to put it. He wasn&#x27;t suprised she would suggest something like this if he was honest. He would do the same if he would be in her situation but then again the two of them just met. His expression changed again, a smirk wanderd onto his face and his confidance came back to him.* **&quot;Only if you don&#x27;t mind some cuddling.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle.* **&quot;I don&#x27;t know how much you move around while sleeping so I just want to make sure that we don&#x27;t wake up in a weird situation.&quot;** *He says with a grin.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Arizys was glad that he didn&#x27;t complain about her nose-flicking much. She did try to do it as gently as possible, but her chirpiness definitely got her to flick a little harder than intended at times.* **&quot;Mhm. Village where I was from wasn&#x27;t exactly big, and..&quot;** *She cut herself off, before shaking her head. Not going there now. When the angel blue Dragonborn had hopped past him and on to the bed, Aghayon would get a good whiff of her scent as she passed him too.. the gentle mix of a fresh mountain breeze, wet cut grass, and the tiniest hints of floral scents. Arizys certainly took a sniff of his musk on the sheets too, and got a little giddy in her drunk state before taking another deep inhale of it. She finally looked back at him when he laid down next to her.* **&quot;You&#x27;re sleeping on the bed too.. here.. with me.&quot;** *Arizys felt inexplicably shy for some reason when saying that, but she quickly covered it up with some bravado and other reasons.* **&quot;I&#x27;m not gonna let a dummy hunk be uncomfortable for the sake of my own comfort. So as long as we can both be comfortable, I guess I don&#x27;t mind this.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon rubed his nose after he got flicked again and laughed a little about it before he tilted his head. Never had a boyfriend before? Huh... That suprised him mire then he wanted to admit since she was quite the looker and after being with her for this little while also someone that was probably a blast to be with.* **&quot;Realy? Huh... Thats actualy a bit unexpected.&quot;** *He says before making a bit space for her as she jumps into the bed face first, giving her a good whiff of Aghayons scent that was clinging to the sheets. A condition huh? Aghayon lifted a brow and lay down next to her on his side, head resting on his hand he propped up with his elbow like before on the couch to look at her.* **&quot;Alright? Whats the condition?&quot;** *He says with a smile. He would be probably fine with whatever so he just smiled in anticipation.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-02</p> <p class="message">*The angel blue Dragonborn just smiled at him before blep-ing for a moment, giggling playfully after before lowering her hand to flick his snout gently.. more lightly than she had done the other times. Arizys returned his soft gaze with her own confident one, though it was likely boosted by the alcohol in her system too.* **&quot;Nope, never had one. Never found the right person, nor felt the need to pursue love.&quot;** *Though she could easily say that now, a part of her had wanted to explore romance more.. but due to the circumstances she was in, she thought it was a pipe dream and just shunted it away for the future for now; at least until she got her retribution or had a good reason to pursue it now.* **&quot;Hm.. One condition.&quot;** *Arizys suddenly hops up and flops on to the bed face-down, melting into the comforts of the bed before she glanced back at Aghayon for him to ask about what said condition was.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon lets out a soft chuckle as she got up and pat his head as he looked down to the ground.* **&quot;Yeah...

Lissa was never a bad topic for him but his status of a relationship was something else entirely especialy when he had to explain the situstion with Lissas mother. Aghayon closes his eyes a little before he looked out of the open balcony, seeing thst it was getting dark outside already.* **&quot;And I can&#x27;t convince you to sleep in the bed instead?&quot;** *He asked before he turned his head towards her again and looked up.

It seemed they had both stepped on a conversation landmine for each other, so they were maybe equal now or something? Not exactly right at all.. The angel blue Dragonborn just nodded slowly as he explained it all to her, understanding that he was worried for Lissa. It was an extremely valid reason after all, and she felt bad for him. She put the pillow she was hugging down back on to the couch, and slowly got up.. approaching Aghayon before stopping in front of him. Arizys&#x27; actions were currently affected by her drunken mind, but that just meant this was all the more genuine. Her hand slowly reached up, and stopped on Aghayon&#x27;s head.. before she began to pat him softly.* **&quot;You&#x27;re.. a very kind person.. has anyone told you that?&quot;** *She giggled a little, her cheeks a much brighter red now.. almost as if the alcohol was affecting her more and more now that it was getting into her system properly. Arizys was even swaying a little now, but kept her footing still.

I tried to be with her... several times... and we tried to make it work for Lissas sake but... In the end... I had to let go... And... now I can&#x27;t even go and see her anymore... My bond with Valasjera is still a big mysterie for both for us and I fear that her presence could influence Lissa in a unforseen way...

When Aghayon began to explain though, the angel blue Dragonborn slowly calmed down.. nodding along to what he was saying before waving at her a little too. She was indeed a cute child, and she was happy that Aghayon had a happy ending despite the decision being stupid at first. A part of her was a little jealous though.* **&quot;Ah.. she certainly looks lively! I guess that means you&#x27;re married now.. or something?&quot;** *Arizys had jumped to a few conclusions which had likely led to more confusion within herself, but hopefully the black Dragonborn could clear things up. A part inside her was really disappointed for some reason though.. but she still kept up her genuine smile as she was still happy for him after all.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon smiled warmly a little before he held up his hand before he made a lifesize illusion of the 5 year old albino dragonborn in a lovely flower patterned dress that was his Lissa.

Aghayon&#x27;s clarification certainly cleared things up a great deal, and she now got the point of it. Alcohol makes people do stupid things with stupid results, but occasionally good ones. Arizys couldn&#x27;t help but smile a bit though when the black Dragonborn seemed to so happily talk about his daughter. She wasn&#x27;t bothered by the fact that he has offspring, and instead was a little curious.

Thats what alcohol can do to you.&quot;** *He says before letting out another sigh before he had a very warm smile on his face.* **&quot;It was worth it though... My daughter is the most presious thing I have ever seen and I would unhinge the world for her.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hah! I knew you were bluffing!&quot;** *She stuck out her tongue and winked at the same time, chuckling after before shaking her head endearingly towards Aghayon. Arizys shrugged when he said he was going to make virgin drinks for them next time. She was indifferent about it, being fine both with or without alcohol. Maybe she&#x27;d save this warm feeling in her body for special occasions. Drinking too much was likely not a great idea too anyways. When Aghayon suddenly dropped the bomb about him having a child with another woman, Arizys dropped her jaw at first.. feeling a little speechless, before averting her gaze. It seems she took the wrong message away from that as her cheeks reddened further.* **&quot;Stupid hunk! W-Whaddya talking about.. making children.. I&#x27;m not gonna make a child with you either way!&quot;** *Definitely the wrong message from that.. The angel blue Dragonborn shook her head, confusion clearly on her face.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon couldn&#x27;t argue with that discription of him. He was all three things she thought hunk ment. He was fiarly tall and had a nice build, he wws in his thirtys so he considerd himself old and he was certainly a dummy most of the time. The dragonborn chuckled as he opend his eyes again and looked at her with a smile.* **&quot;You know what? Ok... If you think that is what hunk means then yeah... Your right about that.&quot;** *He says before smirking a little.* **&quot;And yeah... I thought as much. Next drinks I make for you are either alcohol free or have just very little in them... I could see our antics being able to escalate when were both inibriated... Last time I made some deciscions while totaly drunk while being with a woman I liked I ended up with a child.&quot;** *He says openly basicly to just see her reaction to that bomb he just dropped.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*She shook her head a little as he admitted that he had done more dumb stuff while drunk, and she just sighed a little before giggling. Arizys found this little moment of vulnerability of the Dragonborn beside her to be incredibly cute and endearing, and she appreciated his attempts at trying to make her feel better. A part of her was a inexplicably a little sad when Aghayon had gotten up and sat across her on the bed instead.* **&quot;I&#x27;m.. gonna hold off on making decisions while drunk.. I can barely think properly while just being tipsy already.&quot;** *She blep-ed for a moment, before raising an eyebrow when Aghayon tried to correct her.. rolling her eyes when he winked again.* **&quot;Pffft yeah right. Hunk means a big ol&#x27; dummy, and you sure as hell are one.&quot;** *Arizys said teasingly, sticking her tongue out after as she kicked at the air between them, her tail wagging slightly behind her too.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Not the only dumb thing I did while shitfaced.&quot;** *He said after a moment after her second punch before he turned his headvtowards her and smiles. He wouldn&#x27;t pry about her tattoo though. He felt like they weren&#x27;t there yet and it was her call to tell him or not.* **&quot;And you&#x27;re welcome... I just want to make you feel welcome and sound here...&quot;** *He says before he actualy gets up after a moment and sits down on the bed across from her, finaly giving into her demand of using the couch.* **&quot;And well... When you&#x27;re drunk you don&#x27;t think realy straight either... It can lead to some realy weird and bad stuff... Or actualy very good stuff as well but its hard to find those situations. Also yes... I am a dumb hunk. Dumb because I ain&#x27;t the brightest and a hunk because I&#x27;m looking good while also working out.&quot;** *He says with a wink.* **&quot;Thats what Hunk means by the way.&quot;** *He says chuckling a little before he mellowed down a little and loweringbhis eyes to the ground. It was easy to tell for him that she wasn&#x27;t much younger then him but she had a aura of innocense and inexperience around her that she hid by being at least as cocky as he was.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Arizys glanced between the tattoo and Aghayon as he explained its origins and his feelings about it, keeping silent as she just listened. Though their tattoos were far from similar, something about him telling her about it comforted her a bit.. and made her feel a bit more comfortable with him even if she wouldn&#x27;t openly admit such a thing. When he finally finishes and looks up while closing his eyes, her soft smile returns to her face.. a genuine curl of scaly lips paired with an understanding gaze.* **&quot;You&#x27;re a real dummy hunk, y&#x27;know that?&quot;** *She punches Aghayon lightly on the shoulder, trying to lighten up the mood.* **&quot;Making bets while drunk.. If being tipsy makes my head spin like this.. yeesh.. You must have balls of steel to put things on stake while inebriated.&quot;** *Arizys keeps the smile up as she retracts her fist, then softly punches Aghayon&#x27;s shoulder again.. which was followed by a moment of silence, which she would break again.* **&quot;Thank you.. for trying to comfort me. I appreciate it, Aghayon.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon ran his hand over his tail and the tattoo when she asked and suddendly regrettet it to have shown her his own tattoo. Hers had probably a deep sitting meaning of hurt and hardship.* **&quot;It is a sign of my own drunken idiocy, my hubris of always trying to stand up to a challenge... And it is a great source of emberasement to me as well... I try to hide it as much as I can though I promised a friend to not be so emberrassed about it...&quot;** *He says before he lets out a deep sigh before looking at the ceiling for a bit before he takes the hand from her knee and his tail away from his lap.* **&quot;But in the end... The tattoo has no meaning... It is just the sign of a lost bet while I was dead ass drunk.&quot;** *He says and closes his eyes.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Arizys averted her gaze when he got up, still thinking he was just trying to hide whatever tattoo he had too until he sat down beside her. She raised a scaly brow again, wondering what he had to say.* **&quot;I said it was alright.&quot;** *It still did come out a little harsher than she intended. The Dragonborn wasn&#x27;t pissed at Aghayon really, but more annoyed at herself that a mention of one tiny thing could turn her mood upside down so quickly. Her gaze lowered when she felt his large hand on her knee, trying to comfort her, but her mood simply stagnated. When he seemed to try and draw her attention to his tail, Arizys finally decided to look.. narrowing her eyes a little on the green ink around the end of his scaly appendage. She noticed his slight discomfort too, so just kept her gaze up on to his to prevent further embarrassment on his part.* **&quot;I.. suppose this is what you wanted to hide from me? What&#x27;s it.. mean?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon felt bad seeing her mood sour so much and lets out a little sigh before he puts the blanket around his hip before he stands up and sits down next to her on the couch. He was not finished yet with this little contest.* **&quot;Sorry for bringing it up again... And... judging from your reaction your story about it is way worse then mine... I hope you can forgive me.&quot;** *He says as he puts a hand hesitently onto her knee. He brought her here for comfort and a good time and not for bad memories. Aghayon let out a sigh before he just pulled the blanket off of him and threw it onto the bed before he slung his tail around his hip and paces the dextrous appendage onto his lap and shows her the long green veins thst were tattoed onto his tail thst coiled down the tail up to the half way point. He looked incredibly embaressed when showing it off to her.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*A flash of worry entered her face for a moment when Aghayon began coughing, but when he clarified he was fine, she sighed and shook her head.. rolling her eyes at him. When he began hinting at her tattoo though, her smile slowly soured.. the curve of her scaly lips soon flattening as a poker face replaced it. The tattoo certainly brought some unfavourable memories, and it being brought up all of a sudden did bitter the mood a tad bit. Her prehensile tail reached up to the bed, pulling the blanket back down before being tossed on to Aghayon&#x27;s face. Arizys stops straddling him and stands up soon after, hopping off him and on to the couch as he stared down at him. There was a moment of awkward silence as she didn&#x27;t intend for her suddenly soured mood to suddenly affect the banter between them, but such memories just brought bitter thoughts to her head which she couldn&#x27;t simply shake just because she was having a good time.* **&quot;Ah. Alright.. Sorry.&quot;** *Slightly chirpy tone still, but obviously a little forced.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon groaned a little when she landed on his muscular chest.

Not that he wasn&#x27;t enjoying the view though.* **&quot;No... They are not fake... Remember what I saw at the lake?&quot;** *He said at her, trying to remember her for when he got a look on her tattoo on her shoulder with some little visual aid as he points to his own shoulder.* **&quot;Same situation there...

She thought she had come out on top and was able to pull him off the couch safely! Well.. she was successful, but there were some downsides to that.. or upsides.. who&#x27;s comparing anyways. The Dragonborn yelped as she was dragged down by Aghayon, and her drunken mind was too hazy to register it properly until she plopped on to his chest with a grunt. Her mind spun as she fell on the black Dragonborn, and after a few blinks while resting on his chest, she slowly peeled up from him, hands on his chest to hold herself up a little as she was basically straddling him.* **&quot;Friggin&#x27; hunk.. doing dummy thingies.. I thought you would put up more of a fight, hm? These.. muscles fake or something!?&quot;** *She teased him a little, poking his biceps before inexplicably laughing uncontrollable while sitting up.. still straddling Aghayon while her cheeks burned. Whether it was embarrassment or alcohol was unclear now, but either way it was clear she was very happy despite the fall.* **&quot;Are.. you okay though?&quot;** *She wiped a tear from her eye before grinning down at him.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">(Of ocurse now you roll high!)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon was just laughing as she suddendly approached but then pulled the blanket away, revealing his now uncoverd tattooed tail.

She couldn&#x27;t help but see him as a cute hunky dork for a moment, with his book in hand yet still having a muscular frame. The thought was as innocent as possible though, as she didn&#x27;t exactly know what flirting or romance really was. She just found this all to be in friendly fun, and would feel that way unless made super obvious otherwise.* **&quot;Oh.. you are so on, hunk!&quot;** *Her prehensile tail grips the end of the blanket, pulling it off Aghayon in a swift motion and tossing it on to the bed. Arizys got up to his side from the side of the couch, hands holding on to his muscular arm before she began to pull.. trying to get him out of the couch!*

He was happy though she liked the pajamas becase he wanted her to be comfortable and not having to crash on his couch like a drifter she possibly even was. Aghayon wouldn&#x27;t move though while he smiled at her while he still lay there posing.* **&quot;Make me!&quot;** *He says with a big grin because he doubted she had the bodycontroll right now to get him anywhere but staying on the couch. It was also a test to see if the alcohol made her more bold as well or just tipsy. Because then he knew he had to certainly had to tone down the drinks she would get. She wasn&#x27;t much younger then himself so it was suprising for him that she didn&#x27;t had any alcohol by now.

She licked the cream off her upper lip too after seeing Aghayon do it, and let out a steamy sigh of delight as the alcohol settled in her. It felt blissful to be tipsy, Arizys found, and she stumbled a little around the room as he asked how she felt about the pajamas.* **&quot;Honestly.. pretty *hicc* good! Never felt satin before.. but it&#x27;s comfy and smooth against my scales.. and warm too! Or maybe that&#x27;s the ackohol.. alck hoe hole.. alcohol.. blegh.. hard word to say..&quot;** *She then sees Aghayon settled on the couch, and realised their little back and forth was going to last all night long.* **&quot;Hey! I said no buts! Get out and sleep on the bed! The couch is mine.&quot;** *Arizys narrowed her eyes a little, trying to look intimidating, but with her pink cheeks and tipsy sway, she just looked like an adorable shortie failing miserably at trying to get someone to be scared of them.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon looked up from his book and smiled at the cute looking dragonborn.

He was currently wearing a silver satin pajama as well and smiled at her triumphicaly.* **&quot;Hows the pajama? I personaly love the feeling of Satin on my scales.&quot;** *He says chuckling, his tail coverd up under the blanket slapping the couch a little as he was wagging it a little. She was suprisingly taking it pretty chill of him lying on the couch, leaving the bed for her just by being already lying there.

The towel was so fluffy and comfy, and the pajamas felt so nice against her scales too! She put them aside for now and got the little satchel of shower products she had taken out from her bag that was left outside.. the small thing in a pile with her armour and scabbard harness. Arizys soon turned on the shower and cleaned herself properly, letting the warm water wash over each and every inch of her angel blue scales. She scrubbed at them too with the special soap she had bought from Waterdeep, a little concoction which made her smell like a fresh mountain breeze and a slight hint of flowers. As she scrubbed down her smooth scales, she began to hum a little softly to herself, a soft melody which was a vast contrast to her usual brash tone. It reminded her a little of a song her grandmother used to sing for her grandfather, but it was in a language she didn&#x27;t understand. Soon enough as she was done singing, she was done washing up to, and eventually got out the shower to dry herself off. After taking a minute to just enjoy how comfy the towel was, she slipped into the satin pajamas and got out all refreshed.. folding her clothes on the way out before putting it as a neat little pile beside her armour and other belongings.* **&quot;Wooo! I haven&#x27;t had a good shower like that in forever!&quot;** *The pajamas were a little too big for her, but it just made her look more adorable. She walked over to get her drink, and began lapping at the mix of cream and pineapple rum while finally paying attention to what Aghayon may have been doing.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon let out a* **&quot;Pfft.&quot;** *As she called him lame and rather focused on what she was doing when she took another sip of the Pino.

She nodded approvingly, something she&#x27;d never do while sober, at the sight of his muscles and firm pectorals. When the angel blue Dragonborn had realised what she was doing, she immediately cut herself off, clearing her throat as the blood rushed to her cheeks again and turned her pale scales reddish pink. Arizys averted her gaze and instead looked at the couch. It was beaten up for sure, but it was more comfortable than a pile of leaves or other soft natural material she could find in the wild. With her turned around and armourless, Aghayon could properly see her lithe form now. She sure as hell was lean, with some muscle throughout her body due to her athleticism, and had some curves which made her more attractive.* **&quot;If the hunk wasn&#x27;t as lame as you, I would.&quot;** *She rolled her eyes sarcastically before heading over to where Aghayon was, letting him get a better look of her without armour as she got her cocktail and took a sip. Arizys hummed a bit as the mix of cream and rum ran down her throat, and she enjoyed it a great deal.* **&quot;Fine, fine..&quot;** *She licked the cream left on her upper scaly lip before putting the glass back down and heading for the bathroom. Before she got in though, she paused by the door and looked back.* **&quot;Thanks.. for all this.&quot;** *A soft smile spread on her face, clearly genuine, before she got into the bathroom to begin stripping for her shower.* **&quot;And don&#x27;t you dare peek, hunk! Or I&#x27;ll get Venix to taze the shit outta you, ya here me!?&quot;** *Her muffled voice behind the door was followed by a boisterous chuckle.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon snirked as he puts his armor on an armor stand, now wearing only a muscle shirt and his pants, making his pecks being pronounced under his shirt and revealing his muscular arms he was hiding under all his gear. Only thing he kept on besides that was the red leather sheath he had for his tail that was attached to his belt. The Couch was a pretty standard affair and nothing realy special. It was obviously used for when Aghayon was drunk and he couldn&#x27;t be botherd to change out of his clothes and he just needed a place to crash down so the Couch was a bit beaten up from a 200 pound armored Dragonborn crashing down on it now and then.* **&quot;Why do I have the feeling you&#x27;ll rather sleep on the hunk then the bed.&quot;** *He says with a smirk on his face before picking up his drink again while checking her out again as he was just looking at her. Without her armor she was even more of a looker now that everything was a bit more freed up and not so held in place.* **&quot;I&#x27;ll grab you some pajamas and a towel, bathrooms in there.&quot;** *He says, points over to the only other door as he turned around as if he never said anything.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message">*Arizys took a few sniffs as she stood by the door, taking in the scent of the room first. She enjoyed the smell of rain, as rain reminded her of the stormy thunder and lightning overhead which inexplicably calmed her. The extra tinge of Aghayon&#x27;s musk was fine with her too, and she finally decided to walk in. She put the cocktail down by Aghayon&#x27;s, then slots Venixayla into the weapon rack next to his two swords too.* **&quot;A couch is better than what I&#x27;ve been sleeping on most days, hunk. I&#x27;ll be fine.&quot;** *Arizys unbuckled the straps around her midriff, loosening the holder for her scabbard on her back so she could take it off and lay it by the rack too. The Dragonborn then turned away from Aghayon, reaching under her shirt to unclasp a few buckles under her shirt, before the clinking of metal could be heard. She struggled a bit to get the highest one from under her shirt, and decided to reach from above rather than below and finally unclicked it. Her chain armour worn under her shirt falls out and down around her feet, clinking softly before she kicks it next to her scabbard holder too. Her top now clung a lot more comfortably to her curves, making her figure look more attractive before as there was no armour under anymore.* **&quot;Just sleep on the hunk, bed. I&#x27;m fine here.

It felt all realy cozy and nice all things considerd. It smelt like fresh rain in a forrest, mixed with the scent of Aghayon as a light undertone in it.* **&quot;Again, no buts, I just don&#x27;t feel not comfortable with you sleeping of my boring ol&#x27; couch.&quot;** *He says as walks over to the huge chest resting abainst one side of the room and puts his two swords next to it on a special holder made for different kinds of weaponry even though Aghayon had only these two before he walks over to his closet. He takes a sip from his drink before putting it down on a nearby table and starts to take off his coat. He was still in his armor from the Arena fight he had before and started to take it off.* **&quot;But if you are so insistent of using the couch... Just punch the wall over there and it should flop out of the wall.&quot;** *He says as he unbuckles his scale mail armor.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-01</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Aghayon...you&#x27;re alright.&quot;** *She attaches the hammock and rolls in, wishing she had a hot bikini babe beside her and a tiki drink, but this would do.

She also spotted a hammock attached to the tree, just waiting to be attached to the closest wall hook to lounge in.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-10-10</p> <p class="message">(She doesnt find the hidden fold up couch.)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-10-10</p> <p class="message">*Elfrida nods and grabs the food for the wigglers, walking over to toss a few pieces to them.* **&quot;You guys uh...talk or anything?&quot;** *She waited for a response and then looked toward the balcony, curious of how good a view he had.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-10-10</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-10-10</p> <p class="message">(Investigation DC 13)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-10-10</p> <p class="message">*She would find some books about cocktail making, mostly recapies and some for certain stiles of shaker handling in the book shelfs as well as some fiction novels and an outdated Battke Mace rulebook.

She didn&#x27;t deserve nice, not after everything she had done. Not after almost getting her sister killed, becoming a thief, working for the Roxlires. She didn&#x27;t deserve nice...but part of her...most of her...knew she needed it. She needed this kindness to help her remember what kindness felt like. To remember what it meant to people. To remember...how to be kind herself.

She couldn&#x27;t ask Vae after working for the guys who beat him senseless and locked him up in a workshop, and she wasn&#x27;t ready to join this guild just yet regardless of what her sister said. So here she sat in an uncomfortable chair, in her PJs in the room of a guy she barely knew practically begging just for a roof to sleep under. She almost missed working for the Roxlires...almost.*

He had not much say in this because he passed out shortly after that thought.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-09</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-04</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon looked behind him, noticing he missed to cover up the tattoo on his tail and facepalms audible.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t tell Kessan...&quot;** *Aghayon says but Kjara just smiles.* **&quot;Oh I will!&quot;** *She says poking him in the chest.* **&quot;Jeez Aghayon! Have you worked out or something?&quot;** *She asks, poking his pecks some more.* **&quot;Gods...&quot;** *She shakes her head. Aghayon has always been athletic but not like that.* **&quot;We have a lot of catchup to do Red. Maybe I should begin with how I got those scars.&quot;** *He says before he begins to givr Kjara the rundoen what happened to him.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-04</p> <p class="message">*Kjara just looked at Aghayon baffled. How could he be so casual about this? Maybe she just lived in Waterdeep to much but for her the whole situation felt like a death sentence.* **&quot;Are you realy sure that will work? That appologizing will just solve this situation?&quot;** *She asks him a bit hystericaly before Aghayon just puts his hand on her snout and looks her in the eyes.*

**&quot;Yes Kjara, I am!&quot;** 

*The female dragonborn just looked at him. He xaid that in a tone she had never heared from him. He was dead serious about this.* **&quot;Ok...&quot;** *She said in a very low voice, feeling like she had offended her best friend as well. She realy needed to work on her people skills again regarding friends and family.* **&quot;Sorry for yelling...&quot;** *She said, looking down.*

**&quot;Nah its all good Red. You just put your brain into a wrangler for nothing. Just go to him tomorrow and apologize and he will understand, I am sure. Also...&quot;** *Aghayon looks her over.* **&quot;You probably shouldn&#x27;t wear something like that then... You look like you wanted to be checked out by him on purpose.&quot;** *He says chuckling, noticing her rather lax and revealing outfit. Kjara just punched him for that and leaned against him with a pout.* **&quot;You better shut up mister commando tramp stamp...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well I can tell you! He will feel weirded out by you just storming of like that! You should go back and apologize girl! And not because you fight a prince but because you were dumb and just ruined a nice date! He&#x27;s probably thinking you didn&#x27;t appreciate his hospitality or something! You need to chill out Red! He is just a Guildmember just like you! Status is meaningless here unless you make a big deal out of it and so far? That Vian guy didn&#x27;t look like was making one of it! Look at your brother for example! He doesn&#x27;t throw his title around, playing the big nobleman! He&#x27;s even marrying someone withot a noble titel or anything like that! He&#x27;s just him here, just like we were back home!&quot;**

*Kjara was listening to him sobbing but... It helped hearing Aghayon saying those scolding words to her. It put everything a little bit more into perspective.* **&quot;You&#x27;re sure?&quot;** *She asked and Aghayon nods at her.* **&quot;Hundret percent! He might be from a different land and culture but he&#x27;s also just a guy! Maybe a bit stuck up and high on honor but still just a guy! Wait till tomorrow or so and then apologize to him. If he&#x27;s to cranky or not forgiving, just send him my way and I beat some sense into him ok?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;There there Red! There is nothing to worry about that!&quot;** *He says, rubbing her shoulder softly.* **&quot;You are both Guildmembers... So his status doesn&#x27;t mean shit in the Arena.&quot;** *He says with a chuckle but Kjara just kept wailing.* **&quot;But I am of noble birth Aggy! I can&#x27;t just brush this aside like it means nothing! I raised my hand against royalty! I...&quot;**

**&quot;Listen Red! You challenged him to a fair duel and did nothing wrong. You also lost so his honor is still intact! You have done no harm!&quot;

&quot;But why do I feel like shit then huh? Why does this fill me wih so much dread! You know he has the right to kill me now right?&quot;

&quot;Vian has no such right Kjara! Nobody does! And even so, do you realy think he would kill you?&quot;

&quot;YES! YES I THINK HE WOULD!&quot;** *Kjara screamed at Aghayon with tears in her eyes. **&quot;When we fought... I felt that he didn&#x27;t hesitate! Every Kick, Every Punch felt like he wanted to take me out! My stomach still hurts from that last kick! I feel like shit since that fight! I have had nightmares and shivers! I went out with him for breakfast this morning and afterwards went to his room for some painting lessons and everything was fine and realy nice but... Now that I know that he is royalty... I just fled Aghayon! I ran away and buried my face in the toilet for a solid hour! I have no Idea what he will do! How he will react!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-04</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon was ruffling through the chest with all his belongings, looking for his swimwear as he hears a knock at the door.* **&quot;Gimme a sec!&quot;** *He shouts towards the door as he puts on some pants before he goes to the door. Outside he found Kjara, shaking nd eyes red from tears, her cheeks wet and she looked like she had thrown up for a while.
Upon seeing Aghayons scars though, Kjara&#x27;s expression changed from sadness to shock because the black scaled dragonborn was currently topless. 

**&quot;What the heck happened to you?&quot;**

**&quot;What the heck happened to you?&quot;**

*Both asked at the same time before Aghayon chuckled and Kjara just looked... Even more miserable.* 
**&quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it Red. Come in, your problem is a bit more urgent then these.&quot;** *Aghayon says, pointing to his scars.
The female Dragonborn blinks and, shrinks a little bit and walks in, just sitting down on the edge of Aghayons bed, her tail trembling on the rough fabric of his blanket.* 

**&quot;You remember Vian right? The blue dragonborn who beat the shit out of me in the Arena?&quot;** *She asks him as Aghayon closes the door and walks over to her.* **&quot;Sure Red! That guy looked intense. Somethin happen? Did he hurt you and I need to set him straight?&quot;** *He asks as he sits down.

Kjara shakes her head and starts holding her elbows.* **&quot;No... Not at all... He is... actualy realy nice when you get to know him...&quot;** *She says as she shvers.* **&quot;But... Something did happen... He.. He is a prince Aghayon! I fought a Prince!&quot;** *She said and burrowed her head inside her hands. The male sighes and puts an arm around her shoulder, holding her softly against his side.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-30</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-30</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-30</p> <p class="message">**&quot;But what if it happens again?&quot;** *Kessan asks his friend, his throat sore.
Aghayon sighes.* **&quot;If you only think of what could happen you never get shit done in this world Silver.&quot;** *He says, taking the bottle from Kessan and takes another big swig.*

**&quot;I...&quot;** 

**&quot;Look, you&#x27;re a maker, a tinkerer. You know how it is, you think you have figured out how a dodat works, build it and test it to just expload into your face. Thats how the world works. You don&#x27;t cry after a failed experiment right?&quot;** *He says towards the silver dragonborn.

Kessan thinks about this and sighes. He takes the vodka and drinks a good chunk of it.* **&quot;Ugh... From what sewer did you pull this shit?&quot;** *He says. This alcohol was the worst stuff he ever had in his life.* **&quot;This is worse then the shit we had at Steve&#x27;s birthday that one time.&quot;**

**&quot;Hah! Fuck Steve but you&#x27;re right. Also I knew it distracts you. So... Let&#x27;s catch up a bit and enjoy this gross beverage. Maybe I share your parents Peach liquor with you. Still got my bottle they gave me when I met them last time and we sould kill it soon.&quot;**

*Kessan nods and takes another swig, nearly retching.

So the two catched up, talking basicly the whole night with eachother. Getting drunker then ever since they graduated. Just this time with an old friend he hadn&#x27;t seen for years helped him and now knowing that Aghayon was here, made Kessan even more at home at tjis guild then before. He needed to do a service for this guild at some point, he just knew it. In the morning the two Dragonborn parted. After shared tears, shared booze and shared laughter. It was good for the two to have eachother again.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-30</p> <p class="message">**&quot;My god... Kessan...&quot;** *He says, walking over and hugging his old friend. Kessan just wailed into the shoulder of Aghayon while the black scaled dragonborn comforts him. They just sat ther together until Kessan was close to passing out.* **&quot;Why does this happen to me all the time Aghayon? Why?&quot;** *He asks and his friend sighes.*

**&quot;Its a world of Magic buddy... A lot of shit is going down and you can&#x27;t predict what happens to you. Look at me for example, I nearly fucking died! If it weren&#x27;t for a lucky coincidence, the girl I loved picked my up like a hot potsto and tossed me around even though we have a Kid together!&quot;** *He regales, his life tragic but not as fucked up as the one of his friend.* **&quot;But I&#x27;m still me regardless. You went through a lot of shit Silver but thats over. You live now because you lived through that shit!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-30</p> <p class="message">*After that botched Monsterfight, Aghayon helps his old friend into his room, putting Kessan carefully on his bed. The bed groaned under the weight of the armored dragonborn but this one was build quite sturdy. Kessan was still a mes while Aghayon walks over to the large chest where he stored most of his posessions and some booze he regularly takes from the Guild hall. He pulls out a perticular nasty  bottle of Vodka and pulls one of his stools closer. He opens it and takes a swig with a growl.* **&quot;God thats nasty.. Exactly what you need.&quot;** *He says, giving Kessan the bottle who just looks at it.* **&quot;Have you forgotten how to drink with your giant brain Kessan?&quot;** *He says, teasing his friend and sighes. Aghayon gets up and places Valasjera and Emberfang aside.

Kessan was just shaken. It was a while ago that he was being mind controlled but it weight still on his mind and today it all just came back. He heared Aghayons voice, saw the bottle but had no Idea what to do. This was all so fucked up.

**&quot;Holy shit Kessan snap out of it.&quot;** *Aghayon says as he grabs his friends face and looks at him.* **&quot;What happened to you? You&#x27;re taller, your scales feel like they are out of metal and you sit here wailing. What went down?&quot;** *He says, sitting down again and looking at his friend.

Kessan looks at Aghayon and just starts talking. He told him about his time in the Army, his marriage and what happened to her. Afterwards he was just a absolute wreck, sitting there with an empy look.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-30</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/712502455400923146/716130539979145276/EZPD4fOXkAIMoyp.jpeg"/></li>
