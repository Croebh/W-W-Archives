They were more in the process of nerding out over  Arrius and Gadgets Battlemace Setup! The two, even though sending stones were supposed to be rather silent, could overhere quite the ruckus and a very very cringe reply chain from Kessan before he asked the two if they wanted to come to the Guild Hall. Appearantly his Sister insisted that he and his adopted daughter introduced his Fianc√© to Pizza and since the possibility was high that Aghayon would drop into that eventualy, he asked if the two wanted to tag along to eich Arrius just shrugged and looked at Gadget.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-09-11</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Or X40-C.

I&#x27;m right behind you.&quot;** *Gadget looks toward Arrius and shrugs, walking with him out the door while Olive looks over the battle map for a few moments and smiles.* **&quot;Ya know...if he can beat Broin...he might be the one...&quot;** *Olive smiles and lets out this haughty laugh before turning to head out of the room.* **&quot;Phew-Phew-Phew! Arrius, welcome to the family. Finally, my vengeance against the underground Battlemace circuit is at hand. Phew-Phew-Phew!&quot;** *She whispers this to herself before closing the door behind her.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Its a... hmm... I never went into the Kitchen now that I think about it...&quot;** *He says as he gets up slowly after giving Gadget another hug. This went way better then he originaly expected! He and Gadget had wrecked their brains how they would do this for weeks now after Gadget gt that letter from her mom and it was a stressfull time. But in the end it all worked out!* **&quot;Thank god we didn&#x27;t had to use plan X25-D&quot;** *He whispers to Gadget while he was thinking about all the plans they had made.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Gadget nods happily, really wanting to see Broin again. It had only been about a year or so but it felt like SO MUCH longer. Oliva rubs her neck and is a little tired, but she has one more stop to make before she can rest up. Okay, maybe a snack wouldn&#x27;t hurt...* **&quot;Food sounds great! Gadget tells me its automated or something. Looking forward to figuring out how that works!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Arrius smiles.* **&quot;Looks like we have to go to Neverwinter at some point to meet your uncle Gadget.&quot;** *He says with a competitive fire in his eyes. Playing against Gadget always was fun and a challenge but if there are more players out there like Olive then he had to meet them at some point.* **&quot;I bet you&#x27;re pretty exhausted from your travel here. Did you have something to eat yet? We have some great food here.&quot;** *The Aarakocra was incredibly happy that Gadgets mother had accepted him and with the blessing from her there wasn&#x27;t much that realy kept him from proposing to Gadget... Or he could pull a sneaky on her and just marry her during one of their cuddle sessions with the ceremony spell.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Gadget&#x27;s eyes widen as Arrius speaks but then she just has this happy, sweet looks as she smiles and blushes heavily, holding him close. She loved loving him and being loved by him and wanted to keep on doing so forever. Olive sees this and nods, satisfied with what she had seen from the both. When asked where she learned to play though she waved her hand dismissively like it was no big deal.* **&quot;Oh I play with some folks form Neverwinter on occasion, one of whom is an adventure Gadget knows well.&quot;** *Olive says this with a smile and Gadget smiles excitedly.* **&quot;You mean uncle Broin!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Arrius poofes up, first in happiness and then in fear again after hearing Olives words before he sits back up.* **&quot;Thank you... Olive...&quot;** *He says as he puts an arm around Gadgets waist and smiles at her.* **&quot;I will do everything in my power to make Gadget happy... I swear to you... I will give everything to keep Gadget save and happy.&quot;** *Arrius was dead honest. If he was sure about anything in his live then it was his feelings he had for the beautiful and intelligent Tiefling next to him. He places a wing over Gadgets back and pulls her close to him.* **&quot;But you have to tell me something... Where did you learn to play like that?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Gadget looks at him and then just smiles warmly before walking over and sitting next to him, letting him rest his head on her lap. She runs a hand through his feathers and smiles. Olive sees this and lets out something like a relieved sigh, though she doesn&#x27;t say why. Instead she walks over and sits down across form them both.* **&quot;You&#x27;re an honest lad, I can tell, and I know if you two do decide to tie the knot you&#x27;ll both put your all into it. So, if and when you do decide it&#x27;s what you want, you have this cranky but gorgeous gnome&#x27;s blessing.&quot;** *She reaches over and puts her hand on her daughter&#x27;s and smiles, Gadget looks like she was about to cry as she smiled brightly. Olive held back her own tears and sniffed a bit before speaking again in something of an after thought.* **&quot;Besides, if he did break your heart I wouldn&#x27;t stop chasing after him until he was ready to pay the piper for his crimes against you...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Arrius was burned out and exhausted.

I have the silver dust right here...&quot;** *He says before he just... keels over and falls onto the cushioned floor as he raises his arms in victory.* **&quot;Hot damn... Olive? That was rough! You roll burning dice!&quot;** *He says with a big smile before looking at Gadget with a grin.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Gadget...stares for a moment before flipping over a few pieces of furniture with this shocked and disconcerted look on her face before screaming.* **&quot;MOOOOOM!!!&quot;** &lt;:concern:720366354456117269&gt;</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Six hours later...*

*Olive screams Arrius&#x27; name towards the heavens in a mix of rage and battle fervor as her forces lay devastated. Gadget...is extremely aroused as she sees boyfriend standing weary but victories over his foe. A moment or two passes as Olive catches her breath from all the screaming, puts her hands on her hips, and nods before looking toward Arrius wth a smile.* **&quot;Alright, you can marry her now.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">https://images.app.goo.gl/uAfkkVJ6JvR3Stbn6</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">(Gadgets mom right now)</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Arrius takes up something from behind the piece of terrain and places it in plain sight.

Street rules, down and dirty.&quot;** *As he reveals the grand general of the manperium.* **&quot;And thank you for bringing your forces into position.&quot;** *He says as he takes his hands from Ursaka E. Creed.* **&quot;The tincans, as you called him, are the Hammer of the Manperium! But! A Hammer is nothing withoug an Anvil!&quot;** *He says, spreading his wings,,revealing a whole table full of Valkyries and Cadians just waiting to pour onto the battlefield.* **&quot;Time for some rapid deployment don&#x27;t you think?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">**&quot;GET HER BABY BIRD!!!&quot;** *Gadget cheers, even though the opponent was her mother.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Olive raises her eyes brow and then a hint of concern crosses her eyes. She looks at her troops and starts crunching numbers. DAMN, how could she have made such a rookie mistake!? She slams her hands on the table, and sounds angry as she speaks...yet...* **&quot;You crafty bastard...&quot;** *, she says with a smile, excitement boiling up in her as she draws back her commandant, but by then it was already too late...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Arrius looked at her but didn&#x27;t budge* **&quot;Go ahead.&quot;** *Just said as he looked over to Gadget just by twitching his dark bird eyes. It was hard for many to notice when he moved his eyes but Gadget knew him long enough. And the look he was giving her was the one of someone who had no controll over the situation but there was also a mischie ous glint in his eyes.* **&quot;If you think that will give you a further edge over a already beat opponent.&quot;** *He says with a twitch in the corners of his mouth.* **&quot;But...&quot;** *He says as he looks at a little bit of terrain he had used to hide something special.* **&quot;You&#x27;ll see that all that was futile.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Olive smiles, seeming to have been impressed by Arrius&#x27; reply and the focus he was giving to the game. Still, she wasn&#x27;t convinced just yet.* **&quot;I think I&#x27;m going to use a command point to activate my commandant&#x27;s psionic skill on...yes, you&#x27;re single tech cleric. Wise decision keeping him in the back near your mechs to keep there wounds down, but lets see how long they last without his support...&quot;** *She reached to roll the dice and Arrius was faced with a choice: burn his last command point to activate a counter psionics from his commander but then not have anymore if something worse came up, or let his tech cleric get controlled and become unusable perhaps long enough for her to destroy his mech units once and for all. The choice was his to make...assuming she even rolled high enough to do so.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Arrius was on edge. She was good! Realy good... Every attack was parried, every little advance repelled. There was so little he could do and he was driven into a very perculiar situation. This was a whole nother level of play. Arrius was no beginner in this game and he had played against dragons and angels alike back in his days as a guardian of bahamuts palace. He might be unable to repell her attacks but... He could parry her questions.*

**&quot;Something I will not talk about. A gentleman does enjoy but not talk.&quot;** *He says as he looks up and he flicks his wrist to drie up the spilled drink with magic.

Arrius knew that this was a hard game, so hard even that he had to drop the concentration on the illusion. The Code Mom Protocoll was good but he hadn&#x27;t anticipated that Olive was such a hard nut to crack. He still had units in reserve but it was not yet the time.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*And they were off. Olive scattered her forces into smaller units and had them doing hit and run tactics while cutting off larger units and witling them away, only to retreat when Arrius would send another squad to back them up. It became exceedingly clear, exceedingly fast that Olive played this game DIRTY. Ever little thing she could do to get an edge, she took, and any short coming she could exploit...she exploited the hell out of it. And all while she was surgically attacking Arrius&#x27; forces...she was going straight for the jugular.*

**&quot;So what was it like deflowering my precious baby girl?&quot;**

*Gadget was mid drink when he mother asked this, spewing liquid all over the floor and coughing so hard she couldn&#x27;t even mount a response.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*The Aarakocra poofs up a little bit. Gadget had warned him that her mother could be intense but this? It was like standing right in front of the god manperor of mankind himself.* **&quot;We&#x27;ll see about that.&quot;** *He says with a slight higher pitch as he flaps his wings a little bit as he places a illusion around them and the table.* **&quot;Because this iw now an ultra game!&quot;** *All or nothing! Just as planned!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*Gadget gave him the thumbs up of approval, but Olive just looked toward him with a furrowed brow, then at her daughter, then back at him.* **&quot;You two really thought I&#x27;d buy this? *Sigh* come on then, I&#x27;ll kick your pansy armor boys&#x27; asses and then have you telling me your darkest secrets by morning. And we playing this game street rules, so you better not think a couple of fancy relics are gonna save you from the Inquisition!&quot;** *She throw off her back and reaches in, pulling out a inquisition army with war nun units baked in. Gadget was sweating bullets but just gave Arrius a thumbs up and fake smile. This was not going to be a game...it was going to be an interrogation with dice rolls.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*It takes a little bit of time before the door flies open. His room was dark and hard to look in but since darkvision was a freemium these days the reveal was a little bit short noted. Arrius was standing behind a new table he had set up in the last few weeks since the old one got a little bit small for their more and more epic battlemace 40 million games. Arrius was wearing a white and blue robe as he spreads his wings and started to glow, illuminating the room as he looks up with a bright smile towards Gadget and her mother.* **&quot;Hello Miss Glimmerbottom. Welcome, to my humble room.&quot;** *He says as the courtains gets opend and the table was revealed to both Gadget and Olivia.* **&quot;Ready to play a game?&quot;** *He says, motioning over the two Armies set up on the table with a talon hand full of dice. The Code Mom protocoll in full effect.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-25</p> <p class="message">*A frantic knock comes at Arrius&#x27; door, Gadget borderline yelling form the other side.* **&quot;Arrius, Arrius, Arrius!

A few seconds pass before there is a light knock at the door.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-25</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-25</p> <p class="message">*Arrius just smiles and holds her close and slipping into a nap shortly after.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-06-25</p> <p class="message">*Kri takes off.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-25</p> <p class="message">*Gadget wastes no time snuggling into him, getting super cozy against his feathers.

I&#x27;ll uh...I&#x27;ll make it up to you later...&quot;** *She got off of him and straightened her clothes a little and then went back to setting up her troops for later, after they figured out what was up with her milkshake and whether it would start bringing more boys to the yard. Honestly she had the one she wanted, so this could become complicated if she wasn&#x27;t careful! Well, there was one way to fix that problem...but later...during hanky panky.* **&quot;Oh, maybe we should keep the whole baby birds thing to ourselves. Pretty sure we can just do a Weave search to figure that out...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">*The Aarakocra wnet through a rollercoaster of emotions as Gadget scolded him, then said about playing the game, then making out before actualy jumping him to sink into the comfortable floor of his room and making out with her. There was now hiding anymore as the towel just bailed when Gadget jumped him.* **&quot;You went from 10 to 11?&quot;** *He asked a bit heated after the kiss, his breath going faster then before.* [Implied NSFW]||**&quot;Also... I need to put on some clothe first! I can&#x27;t go full mast to Maretta!&quot;**|| *He said, being poofed up like crazy.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;ARRIUS!&quot;** *, she said scolding him slightly, though a cup or two bigger wouldn&#x27;t be that bad, and her ass was tighter than ever. NO! FOCUS! This might be serious! You can twerk in front of a mirror in front of Arrius later! Also BABY BIRDS MAYBE!?!?* **&quot;Let&#x27;s go see Grandy! Wait...first I&#x27;m gonna rickety wreck your bro team, then we go see Grandy! Wait, first lets makeout, then I&#x27;ll kick your bro team around, then we go see Grandy! You know what...screw it.&quot;** *Gadget ran over and jumped on Arrius&#x27; straddling him and kissing him sloppily for a good five minutes before coming up for air.* **&quot;Okay! Now we go see Grandy Maretta! Also on a scale of 1 to 10 how&#x27;s my new and improved ass?&quot;** *She looks back, knowing he probably couldn&#x27;t resist.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">*Arrius stood there confused. Sure Maretta was large in her true form and... He looked at Gadget and tilts his head a bit intrigued.* **&quot;I mean... Well... I can&#x27;t say anything right now without sounding like a prick or douche so I wont say anything but...&quot;** *He sits down on his matress floor, his talon feet ontop of the benches around the table.* **&quot;I don&#x27;t mind your new look! I loved you before and found you attractive and that hasn&#x27;t changed! Also... You realy think you will get even bigger boobs?&quot;** *He asks, licking his beak absentmindedly.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Wha...what do you mean hotter? Wait...you mean...&quot;** *She looked at her body, cupping her boobs and looking curious. Then she remembered Maretta...or rather her true form. Holy...* **&quot;It must be...because Maretta&#x27;s my grandy. I mean ever since I found out I&#x27;ve felt more comfortable in my own skin...about being a tiefling. Maybe that triggered something in me. Some kind of...second, super puberty! OH GOD, MY BOOBS CAN&#x27;T GET AS BIG AS HERS!!! THEY NEED THEIR OWN AREA CODE!!!&quot;** *More panicking on top of the panicking she was already doing.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">*Arrius blinks at her as she suddendly speaks about maybe being pregnant. He didn&#x27;t know about that but he doubted that but still... The Thought was weird! Now he was panicking a bit but he kept a straight face.* **&quot;Uhm... No I don&#x27;t think so?&quot;** *He said. He remembered Marettas words and... realized they never thought about using protection actualy... He just assumed...* **&quot;Tha.... Uhm... I have no Idea! But you changed when we came back from Maretta... I brought you to bed and then... Well... You just became hotter?&quot;** *He says, as he walked over to her.* **&quot;Should we... Should we ask Maretta? She would know right?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;OH NOOOO!&quot;** *Gadget grabs her horns, having not expected the best bros to appear! She hadn&#x27;t prepared for that at all! But she wouldn&#x27;t give up! She would persevere...somehow...probably. She let out a sigh and dropped comically until she heard his little comment about know why she felt weird. She looked up curiously toward him and then looked thoughtful. Then she looked surprised. And then a little scared as her hand slowly went to her tummy. Wait...WAIT...* **&quot;Y-You don&#x27;t think...but we&#x27;ve only done it...IS THAT A BIRD THING!? AM I GONNA BE A MOMMA BIRD!?!?!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">*Arrius enjoyed their sloppy way of kissing way to much. Especialy being so close to her while doing so and he chirped a little when they parted again.* **&quot;Well... I can tell you what happened even though I have no Idea why it happened.&quot;** *He said after her little rant about her tighter clothes even though he wasn&#x27;t minding it at all. He just needed to make sure there was enough room under his towel to not show anything.* **&quot;Oh... great... I don&#x27;t have anything against fliers in my list...&quot;** *He sighed at the sight of the airship.* **&quot;Except...&quot;** *He suddendly grins as he pulls out a small box from the shelf and opens it before placing down a rather big model for his marines... And then another... One in the regular green of his dragonmanders and the other one, adorned with silvery wings and a black armor wich looked incredibly depressed.* **&quot;This has become a Brotrip!&quot;** *As he points at Conrad Curz and Vulcan on the table!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;If I give it to you now you&#x27;ll be spoiled! BAH, why not!&quot;** *She skips over to Arrius and gives him another kiss, this one a bit longer. She presses her chest against him and smiles, but then makes a little noise and frowns.* **&quot;Geez...what is going on today?&quot;** *She steps away and adjusts her shirt, or rather the bra she had on under it.* **&quot;My clothes just don&#x27;t feel right today. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;d gained weight if you couldn&#x27;t still shred cheese on my stomach and had a tail tight as a money pincher&#x27;s wallet. Maybe my clothes just shrunk in the wash...&quot;** *She shrugs and walks over to her minis and starts setting them up, bringing a jumbo airship model that she had NOT shown Arrius yet. She looked back at him with a devious smile and just held it in her hands.* **&quot;What? I have enough points for it.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">*Arrius smiles at her as she gave him the kiss on the cheek and let her in, he closes the door behind her and watches her bounce through his all comfort room.* **&quot;Watch out to not turn on the grill when setting up!&quot;** *He said chuckling. Most of the time they had hung out in Gadgets room so he couldn&#x27;t show her what cool things Ethen had eone to their gaming table on Arrius&#x27;s wishes. You could split open the tabletop and slide the two pieces apart and down the side of the table to reveal a japanese stile grill for some on table cooking. He follows her, keeping the towel on for a while longer as he starts to set up his plogeston marines on the other side.* **&quot;Well, told you hot pink was to oversaturated for your colorscheme. But glad you could save it.&quot;** *He said, watching her set up.* **&quot;And I wouldn&#x27;t mind that kiss right now!&quot;** *He says chuckling while looking over her now rounder form. He wasn&#x27;t complaining about it but it was... strange to see.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Nope, practically just got here!&quot;** *She walked in and raised up on her tippy toes to give him a kiss on the cheek before heading down into his inner sanctum to set up her army for his inevitable annihilation.* **&quot;Oh, you tight by the way. The hot pink did NOT work. Was able to salvage it with that dilution trick you taught me, which earns you an extra command point for our battle...and maybe another kiss. Maybe.&quot;** *She turned her head to give him a little wink while raising her leg back for extra cuteness. She took off her shoes before transferring the pillow sea, bouncing a little as she went for fun but also trying to figure out why she felt so odd. Arrius knew though, and could see it clear as day...*

*Gadget had gone from an 8 to a 9 on the thiccness scale but still hadn&#x27;t resized it...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">*There was some shuffling being heared from the room before Arrius opens the door. He was just wearing a towel arond his waist as he opens the door. His room would look like a mess but thats how it always looks. Nearly the whole floor was covered in matresses, blankets and pillows. It looked like a giant pillow fort with only one exception. Built into a lowered portion of the room was a rather large table with benches around them and a set of ceiling high shelfs where his battlemace 40 million figures where lined up in.* **&quot;Hey Gadget! Sorry, just came out of the shower. Hope you didn&#x27;t need to wait to long!&quot;** *The Aarakocra said with a big smile.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message">*A knock comes from Arrius&#x27; door as Gadget stands there hopping a bit, almost she trying to get a feel for something. She&#x27;s currently wearing a t-shirt with the splash art from her favorite WeaveNet game, Globe of BattleForge, alongside a hoodie, pair of fitted booty shorts, sneakers. She has a box with a shoulder strap attached to it within which are her prototype Elder Elf army she was hoping to try out. Typically she would be somewhere between excited and bloodthirsty to test an army with her boyfriend, buy right now she felt super distracted by something.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-09</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*Arrius blinks at Brick but then shrugs and folows the little golem to Gadgets room.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*A scratching sound came from Arrius door, a small but familiar humanoid golem standing there with a yellow gem in its hand. It tapped the gem which glowed in response as a short message from Gadget resonated from it.* **&quot;Arrius! Need you help with a thing! Be in my room! Bye~&quot;** *Brick then flexed with a loud [OH YEEEEEAH!] as was his custom before heading back toward Gadget&#x27;s room.*</p></li>
