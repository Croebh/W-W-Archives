She’d almost reached out to stop him, but thought better of it. She was relieved when the dishware didn’t explode against the kitchen wall, and let out a trapped breath. *He had a point.* Kalo admitted to herself. **”If I ever own some dishes of my own... don’t do that with them.”** She begs.

After composing herself a little (That wink was weapons-grade), Kalo turns and steps out into the aisle. **”Are you coming with, or will I have to find the temple on my own?”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-08-24</p> <p class="message">He nods **”Being well planned is very important.”** he stands up with her **”What seems like recklessness in the moment may just be the product of caution during preparation. Like this.”** As he picks up their two plates and hurls them towards the kitchen. They sail across the room, on a collision course with wall about to shatter into a million porcelain fragments but then, begin to slow like they were attached to an invisible bungee cord and are neatly set down in the dirty dish tray. He looks back at her and winks.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-24</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh... that makes more sense. You need to be ready to face difficulties... Like an idiom.&quot;** *She should have guessed it was something like that.* **&quot;Are there many other sayings like that from the Shadowfell? I can think of a couple I heard from Holorar. I think my favourite is: even an emperor must think twice when looking a tiger in the eye.&quot;** Kalo explains as she gets up from the table. She rubs her shoulder and internally debates whether or not to leave her empty plate here for the kitchen staff to find later. She decides to leave it. **&quot;It warns of the importance of caution too. I&#x27;ve never seen a tiger before though, so it** ***definitely*** **doesn&#x27;t apply to me.&quot;** She says slyly. **&quot;I think i&#x27;d rather be one of the people crushing a few skulls.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-08-23</p> <p class="message">He looks confused and then softens **”Oh, you took that literally. It’s a saying from the Shadowfell. I think they have one here that goes “You can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.” It just means that sometimes bad things have to happen so that you can do what you want.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-23</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I don&#x27;t know if that holds true for everyone.

None of the Ashflowers seemed very religious to me. That’s not exactly the mischief I had in mind... that sort of havoc sounds like it could get us on floor scrubbing duty again.”** Kalo didn’t like the idea of getting caught by another nosy guildmember. It seemed like she was giving the idea serious consideration though. **”Let’s visit this temple then... i’m in for the thrill of it!”** Kalo releases Ashok’s hands so he can get up from the table.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-08-19</p> <p class="message">**”I have noticed that. And I’ll probably be on full alert during the war. Plenty of enemies to collect from too”** he smiles at the mention of mischief **”I haven’t been too the temple much but I am sure we could cause some havoc there.

Got any ideas on where to start?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;This guild job has lots of opportunities for that sort of thing though. As bad as it sounds, there&#x27;s always lots of strong emotions centered around this place.&quot;** Kalo looks down at her hands held in his, then back up to meet his intense eyes. **&quot;And I&#x27;ve never been so happy.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-08-17</p> <p class="message">When she put it that way it sounded like Ashok had a pretty cushy life and to be honest, he did. Everything was hunky-dory. **”My goals now have not changed much. I still want to collect the best deodands and perform feats that solidify as the best Shadar-Kai that ever lived.”** it seems like this should be said with enthusiasm but his normal monotone prevails. **”But, I now have a second equally important goal.”** he looks directly at her and deep into her eyes, he grabs her hands so the she knows they are NOT running through his hair and says **”Creating a life here with you and making sure you’re happy”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-17</p> <p class="message">**&quot;If our goals are aligned, it&#x27;d be pretty great.&quot;** She says, now in a wistful sort of mood. **&quot;That would be just... perfect. Maybe I could convince her to walk Indy in the mornings for me so I could pursue my goal of getting an extra two hours of sleep.&quot;** Kalo giggles, snapping out of it and grabbing up another vinegar-soaked fry. There was an element of seriousness behind it though. As if that really was the best use she could think of for a friendly champion of the upper planes. **&quot;What are your goals Ashok? I mean, now that you have your blackstone back, wooed the girl of your dreams and found pretty steady work... is it all peaches now?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-08-16</p> <p class="message">**”I mean if you’re goals are aligned, AKA kicking ass and taking names, then maybe it won’t be such a bad thing. Especially if this being gave you your powers.”** Ashok thinks about his own scenario it was irreversible and unquestionable he soul was intertwined with the Raven Queen and he enjoyed his work with her, that much hadn’t been changed by his newfound emotions. He had never thought about not serving his goddess and never would but Kalo’s predicament was... different. It sounded like this entity might be like those nobles who underhandedly loaned gold to poor farmers knowing full well they could never pay it back and then commandeered the land when the debt went unpaid. He pulls himself out of his thoughts to add **”But I guess we will have to wait and see what else they ask of you”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-16</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That&#x27;s the problem. I don&#x27;t need another all consuming element in my life. I get enough fulfillment from you and Indy, and the work we&#x27;re doing here at the Guild. Everytime I see Sasha smile, or Mute, Hellfire, the other kids... that makes it worthwhile... I guess all I can really do is wait and see what all these cryptic messages amount to anyway.&quot;** She left it unsaid that she was too prideful to bow to someone else. Only Kalo could tell Kalo what to do.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-08-15</p> <p class="message">Ashok nods he had the coins to spare and would probably try pick those up soon.  **”We definitely should try and go back together”**

He stays silent for most of her story, nodding along at the appropriate points. He tries to speak up about how she described the Shadowfell perfectly if a little generally but fell silent again as she powered through. He knew that this absolute powerhouse who sat across from just hate being under the thumb of some other being. He was in the same position with the Raven Queen but the difference was he had made peace with his benefactor, he had to almost die to do it but it was better now. Now he could collect deodands and return to the Shadowfell without the worry of losing his life here on the material plane. He speaks up and says **”I know that you do not want to be controlled by anyone but working for higher purpose can be fulfilling, hell, for centuries it wasn’t only fulfilling but all consuming for me. Maybe we try and find out what this thing wants and go from there?”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-15</p> <p class="message">Hearing Ashok steer her back on the topic of her dream situation, Kalo began to realize she would have a lot to explain. *Not that she minded. Her more talkative nature coupled well with Ashok&#x27;s regular brooding silences.* **&quot;Well as long as you&#x27;re willing to hear it...&quot;** She runs her fingers through her hair, before leaning in some to speak a little lower. **&quot;On our first date, I told you about the amulet I found on my way to the surface and how it was like a conduit for the power I was learning to use. The full story there is that it belongs to an angel. A proper celestian one from the Seven Heavens. Her name is Ravir&quot;** [Editor&#x27;s note: pronounced Ra-veer] **&quot;and for some reason she&#x27;s trapped in the Shadowfell.&quot;** She looks down at her food. **&quot;I know this because she&#x27;s visited me in my sleep before, like a full-on lucid dream. The first time it happened, I thought it was something purely from my imagination. Then I saw her again and things started to fall into place. I’ve never been to the Shadowfell, but I can tell you exactly what it looks like. An entire realm devoid of colour, where the darkness of the place seems to absorb light. Does that sound right?&quot;** Kalo continues before Ashok can answer. **”She’s like my own… sorta guardian angel I guess, except she expects something from me. I don’t know what. It’s always cryptic things along the lines of ‘you are my instrument,’ or ‘keep it up, failure’s not an option.’ ”** Now Kalo has her elbows propped up on the table and is rubbing her temples.

**”I don’t really like the idea of being anyone’s instrument.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-15</p> <p class="message">**&quot;300 gold. The merchant I bought them from said that they had a whole shop of magic items. It was almost wall to wall junk.&quot;** She has a look that says that she wasn&#x27;t surprised by that discovery. **&quot;We went back and forth on the price for a while, and I think I got a pretty good deal.&quot;** She explains. **&quot;They strap right over my boots.&quot;** Then seeing the slight hint of a thoughtful expression cross his face, she adds: **&quot;I looked for a second pair, but the only other interesting things I saw at the market that day was a magical cittern and a really cool sword that was way out of my budget. You&#x27;ll have to come with some time...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-08-15</p> <p class="message">**”I would love to fly!

Her supple breasts now lightly grazing his face as he lightly puts his teeth to one of them with slightest nibble just to tease her.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-07-02</p> <p class="message">As they move further into her room, Indy looks up from her dog bed in the corner, recognizes Ashok, then lays her head back down.

**&quot;I&#x27;m glad you were with me through that whole Rolxire thing.&quot;** Kalo runs her hand through her hair; possibly a gesture she picked up from spending time with him. **&quot;When Zykk and I went hunting for that frost salamander last month, things got pretty dire, but this quest really stretched us all thin.&quot;** She kicks her own discarded gear to the side of the room; closer to the closet, but doesn&#x27;t actually make an effort to put any of it away.

**&quot;We really do make a troublesome pair. You&#x27;re dangerous...&quot;** She moves his hand to the scar along her hip. **&quot;... and i&#x27;m driven. We even had Kymus scared.&quot;** She grins ruefully at him. **&quot;I love that about us.&quot;** Halfway to her bed, Kalo leans in to kiss Ashok passionately before stripping off her top.

She took this moment to study the features of Ashok&#x27;s face.

*Why the fuck have I been depriving myself of this? Is it always this good or is she just amazing? Probably her. Hmmm, maybe that’s why. Some sort of fate, destiny.

Well, whatever it is I don’t care as long as I can stay with this strong, independent, sexy woman forever.* 

Thinking about forever he remembers catching Ethen and what Fenes said that meant. *Am I ready for that? Is the mortal construct of marriage something I want? Yes.

The tingles she felt radiate across the back of her scalp and down across her whole body, it feels twice as powerful as that night in spent in the club together.

She runs her finger across his scars, tracing all his old wounds. She finds a more recent one on his chest that wasn’t there before and pauses on it for a split second. *Where did that come from?* **”Did you get this one just for me?”** She asks playfully. She kisses the scar, and then kisses just below, following a zigzag path down his torso and beyond...</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-06-01</p> <p class="message">He deftly helps Kalo remove her clothing, undoing the buckles on her leather pants, tossing the weapon belt aside carelessly with a clatter to the floor. He lets out a breath as her hands run down his back. *How does she do that? How does she make a simple touch feel SO GOOD?!* The taste of her skin on his tongue and the scent of her body in the throes of passion driving him wild. He moves his lips down her neck and in between each passionate peck he responds **&quot;I&#x27;ve wanted you.... since the first night..... we danced together&quot;** and then remembering that first lustful evening he moves his mouth up to bite her ear and has to reign in the fire inside to not draw blood.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-06-01</p> <p class="message">Kalo lets herself be carried into her room and she reaches over Ashok&#x27;s shoulder to shut her door behind them. The lovebirds stumbled further into the room, with Kalo nearly tripping over her laundry hamper left in the middle of her floor. She kicks it to the side as her hands work the clasps on Ashok&#x27;s leather armour while his nimble fingers do the same to her. She breathes close to his ear **&quot;I want you Ashok.&quot;** After stripping each other down in a passionate frenzy she wraps her arms around his chest and massages along his back, kissing him again on the lips, slowly maneuvering him toward her bed.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-01</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-05-10</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/709094783989055528/709105262610481213/c6a7fd7458d40fe3fcf5936010e1bee0.png"/></li>
