After all fear is one of the thing that drives us in life.&quot;** Her fingers gently rake through her lover&#x27;s snowy silver strands. **&quot;You know, back in Loudwater, we met a cleric who is badly hurts by a curse. Her wife came with us when we were trying to destroy the undead and break the curse. Then she was taken by the mastermind of the undead. We managed to save her but the one who sealed the evil was her husband who sacrificed his arm, and how happy they were together again.&quot;** 

She  looks up and lands a small kiss on Glenda&#x27;s lips. **&quot;When he carried her wife in his arm, it reminds me of you. Of us, with you carrying me in your hold.

**&quot;When you understand the fear of death, you are closest to being the best of death. I&#x27;m no much but... Even with your fears, you can save others and get to live more and experience more&quot;**

This time she got the room right, for she has asked Valgrim where and which one is the shifter&#x27;s room. After finishing the harrowing mission at Loudwater, she had been made aware of how weak she is, and how much she dreads to die. Which is odd, because she has never feared death before. Is it because she&#x27;s not alone now? Is it because she has a pair of strong arms to welcome her and comfort her?

Nevertheless, she brings herself to knock on Glenda&#x27;s door. **&quot;Glenda? Are you there?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Staticstasis#1063</p><p class="time">2020-10-15</p><p class="message">*After a while of gathering adjusting and matching, Glenda finally adjusted her room to her liking.
