Hyacinth skips over to Storm, gives his wrist a little squeeze and pulls him outside.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-28</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Thanks, Rainbow.&quot;** *Storm grins a little cheekily after the bed was made, walking over to his lover to give her a light hug before heading to his desk.* **&quot;Just an extra moment..&quot;** *He opened a drawer by the side of his desk, going through more notes and pens there before looking a little panicked. His ears twitched a little while his tail jolted straight.. before he opens the next drawer and sighs with relief.* **&quot;There you are..&quot;** *The Tabaxi retrieved a pair of bracers, and they were definitely different looking from last time. When he first got these from Maretta, they were a simple pristine gold with intricate designs on them.. likely runes or sigils which imbued it with magic. Overtime though, they had slowly transformed as Storm grew, and were now a strange purplish platinum.. with the runes and markings now replaced by what almost looked like glimmering gem stars and constellations. He merely shrugged and put them on as he always did before getting into combat or practice, then headed over to the door to open it for Hyacinth.* **&quot;Sorry for that.. Shall we?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-28</p> <p class="message">Hyacinth looks up from her boots to see Storm. **&quot;Almost. Just need to get this...&quot;** She pulls the high boots on one at a time, rolling them up over her knees. **&quot;Wow, it&#x27;s a lot cleaner here now. I should ask you to clean my room too.&quot;** Hyacinth remarks, seeing the neatness of the room for the first time. She stands back up now, scooping the rest of her things off the side table and putting them on. Then she goes over to help Storm tuck in the last corner of his bedsheets precisely. **&quot;Okay! I&#x27;m ready to head back out now and start the day properly.&quot;** She says with a wide smile.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-27</p> <p class="message">*When Hyacinth entered Storm&#x27;s room, it was clearly **much** cleaner than it was when they were having breakfast. Sure nothing was sparkly clean nor lacked specks of dust here and there, but it sure as hell wasn&#x27;t messy anymore. The only books and piles of notes to be found were neatly put at the corner of his desk, likely the ones which he hadn&#x27;t gotten too hence didn&#x27;t return to the library.* **&quot;Hey! Gimme a moment.&quot;** *The Changeling would be able to hear the duvet being tossed, and if she looked, would see that Storm was just about done doing his bed.* **&quot;Ready to go?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-27</p> <p class="message">Hyacinth walks back into Storm’s room after being gone for some time. After bringing the tray back to the Kitchen, she’d taken a bag of peanuts out to give to Sir Tuscany in the stables as a treat and bumped into some people on the way. She’d eventually made her way back here like she promised, hoping Storm was still ready to head to the arena. **”I’m back!”** Tge changeling announces in a soft voice before going over to where she left her boots to pull them on.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hm.. Breakfast. Isn&#x27;t *that* late yet.&quot;** *Storm couldn&#x27;t help but smile widely when Hyacinth kissed his chin. He reciprocated by planting a kiss on her forehead too, the gesture causing his freckles to pulse a darker shade of magenta for a few moments.* **&quot;Well.. we did sign up to be members of an adventurer&#x27;s guild.. Quiet isn&#x27;t exactly too common in places like these, is it?&quot;** *The Tabaxi was indeed about to stop Hyacinth when she got the tray, but she was simply too fast for him. He shook his head while chuckling a little, waving at her as she got out the door before turning to the mess of books kn his desk. Storm justs sighs cheerfully before beginning to pick up the piles of books he was done with already.* **&quot;God I love her..&quot;** *He muttered to himself as he gathered up a portion of the reading material he had borrowed. Storm was going to have to make quite a few trips.. and so he would, rushing in and out of his room.. heading to the library again and again to return pile after pile of books.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-10</p> <p class="message">*She didn&#x27;t want to get out of bed again, but the day had to start at some point.* Hyacinth gets out of the bed too and straightens the sheets, pulling them back in place tightly. **&quot;For breakfast... or brunch? I thought you might like to have a lazy morning after staying up all night with me. We don&#x27;t get many opportunities to just live quietly, do we?&quot;** Hyacinth says, before walking over to Storm, reaching up on her tippy toes and giving him a little kiss on the chin. **&quot;I can take those dishes down to the kitchen if you want to start tidying up some.&quot;** Before he can protest, Hyacinth retrieves the tray from the bedside table. **&quot;I&#x27;ll be right back!&quot;** She heads out of the room once more. *She&#x27;d have to come back here to get her boots and things, and then they could go to the arena together.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-09</p> <p class="message">*Storm&#x27;s tail wagged immediately when Hyacinth magically cleaned her mug, his eyes widening a little with amusement. Magic was such a cool thing, and he was glad he was slowly getting into it through his studying. It was likely going to take quite some time for him to properly manipulate the magic from the Weave and stars so he could use it, but he wasn&#x27;t going to stop. Look at Hyacinth anyways! Her magic was so flashy and cool!* **&quot;Ooo.. sounds good to me! I&#x27;ll get some new books too so I can make some extra notes about how to use spells!&quot;** *The Tabaxi gently took the tray up, placing it on the bedside table before slowly getting out of bed. He stretched a little, a low purr reverberating in his chest before he glances towards his lover with glimmering eyes.* **&quot;Thanks again.. for doing all this. I really appreciate it.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-08</p> <p class="message">**”I could teach you!”** Hyacinth picks up her own mug and holds it up so Storm can see the coffee stains on the inside. **”You just have to believe that you can do it. Prestidigitation!”** Hyacinth’s skin glows faintly for a second, and then the stain in the mug fades away.

She sets the mug down again and looks back at Storm. **”I’ll be there for an hour at least. We could go there together after you’ve put your books away!”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-08</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Ooo.. maybe I could learn how to do that in the future too.. use magic to clean dishes til&#x27; they&#x27;re as sparkly as stars..&quot;** *Storm mused to himself, his ears flicking up a little while his freckles pulsed a wave of deep violet.* **&quot;Hm... sounds good! I think I&#x27;ll work on accelerating with my wings first, as that&#x27;ll be more useful in combat which most of the guild&#x27;s quests involve.. then I can work on reaching higher altitudes, though I may need to get someone to provide me with a safe guard just in case..&quot;** *The Tabaxi poured himself another cup of milk. No more coffee was in his mug, and his was just chugging mug after mug of milk at this point.* **&quot;Will you be at the arena long? If not, it&#x27;s fine, but if you are..&quot;** *He leaned in slowly, planting a light kiss on Hyacinth&#x27;s shoulder before glancing up at her with those dazzling lilac irises of his.* **&quot;..we could train together too?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-08</p> <p class="message">**”If you bring the dishes back to the kitchen, they can clean them with magic.The rest of your day sounds like fun. I know you flew fine last night, but if you’re going to really put your wings to the test, you should probably start practicing closer to the ground. It’s too easy for me to visualize you plummeting to the ground.”** His flying last night was fantastic, but he only just discovered he could do that. Hyacinth just wanted Storm to take things slow and not hurt himself. **”Maybe you can practice flying in the arena to start off?”** She offered. **”If you fall, you’ll land in the soft sand.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Yeah.. never really enjoyed major conflicts like this, but I guess because the higher ups say the Roxlires are evil, and the experiments we saw were clearly.. abhorrent.. I just sucked it up and got it over with quick..&quot;** *Storm&#x27;s mood was a little hampered by the thought of the war again, shivering at the thought of the close call he had before Hyacinth saved him.* **&quot;Hm.. I think I&#x27;ll just be cleaning up my room first.. returning those books.. I can handle the washing up and will return the dishes to the kitchen later too. I may stop by the arena for some physical training later as well. My shoulder&#x27;s a tad stiff from looking down at books all the time, so I think a little workout should get that issue over with.&quot;** *The Tabaxi downed the rest of his milk.* **&quot;Hm.. I suppose I may train my wings on the rooftop too. I.. I&#x27;d like to see what their full potential is soon.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-06</p> <p class="message">**”How about you?”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-06</p> <p class="message">**”I’m looking forward to the end of that guild war. Nobody ever told me why we were fighting them to begin with. That room full of monsters was unfortunate though.”** She furrows her brow. **”I have to spend a little bit if time practicing my magic, but other than that, no plans. I don’t want to accidentally turn somebody into a frog in the middle of a fight. I’ll probably go to the arena later and then stop by the gardens on the way back.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-06</p> <p class="message">*Storm had to giggle a little when Hyacinth finally reached a choice. Roseapple Pie.. well it certainly had become the first thing on the list of dishes he planned on learning. It would certainly be part of the goal of learning more about vegetarianism, but that would be for a later day.* **&quot;Roseapple Pie.. Hm.. You said Jerry from the kitchen helped you to make this, right? I may pay him a visit in the future to learn how to make that, I suppose..&quot;** *The Tabaxi muttered under his breath while sipping on the coffee-laced milk, much preferring the creamy sweet delight rather than the bitterness of coffee. The caffeine certainly was appreciated, but the taste was just abhorrent.* **&quot;Well then.. I suppose we can save the trip to Waterdeep once everything from the war has cooled down.. Do you have any plans for today?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-05</p> <p class="message">**”It’s pretty much an endless list... ”** Hyacinth explained. She had to laugh a little though at how cute Storm was being when she saw him refill his cup with milk for the ninth time. **”Roseapple Pie! That’s my final answer!”** *She picked it because it was the first thing that jumped into her mind when she thought of all her favourite foods. **”I could choose so many but I said that one first. That’s probably my subconscious telling me what to pick.”**

The changeling shifted under the blankets on the bed a little, fidgeting somewhat as she made herself comfy.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-04</p> <p class="message">*Storm&#x27;s ears perked up a little as he made a mental note of the desserts she mentioned, making sure to remember them so he could buy them for her if he did come across it. The other dishes the Tabaxi enjoyed greatly were mostly salty unlike Hyacinth&#x27;s, but that was most likely due to the fact that the more exotic foods he had tried and enjoyed were generally salty. He never really got the chance to have many sweet foods, having only tried ice cream in the hall with her recently, and a few other sugary treats and drinks once in a blue moon. Storm was still perfectly open to trying new things though, and had even thought about learning more about cooking and baking as to make more interesting dishes for himself.. all a part of his journey of self improvement.*

**&quot;Feel free to tell me however many you wish~&quot;** *The feline&#x27;s eyes glittered for a moment, ready to continue taking notes in his mind. Storm was practically done with breakfast too, having had quite a fill and was now just sipping on a 9:1 ratio of milk and coffee from his mug.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-04</p> <p class="message">*Seaweed? That was certainly unexpected. She&#x27;d have to look into finding a restaurant in Waterdeep that served it.* **&quot;Hmm... I don&#x27;t know if I have a good answer for that. Maybe... roseapple pie? Or steamed greenspear. That&#x27;s a healthier option and can be really flavourful with the right recipe.&quot;** Hyacinth responded. **&quot;Honeyflame bread is very nice too, but I only ever had it one time.&quot;** *It was another dessert, a cakey bread that was fried, soaked in honey and coated in spices. Desserts were some of her favourites, from berry tarts, sugar cookies, and sweet fruits, not to mention ice cream. She liked most flavours of ice cream, especially chocolate chip cookie dough and peanut butter fudge.*

Hyacinth was finished eating brunch now, and even though she wasn&#x27;t the least bit hungry, thinking about all her favourite foods still made her mouth water a little. **&quot;Can I only choose one?&quot;** She asked, looking up at Storm.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-09-03</p> <p class="message">*Storm couldn&#x27;t help but let out a toothy grin when she agreed to help him with it. He didn&#x27;t have any expectations, not because he didn&#x27;t trust Hyacinth, but because he was literally too uneducated in the matters of fashion to know what to expect to be given to try out. It would certainly be a fun little trip between them though, and the Tabaxi was **very** excited for it. It would certainly be fun to spice up his wardrobe, just as reading spiced up his life. Trying out new things was indeed the thrill of life after all.*

**&quot;Hm... seaweed! A fishing village I visited had these *massive* farms by the oceanside with ropes suspended in the middle of the water, and the seaweed would grow off those. I honestly first tried it because I was drunk.. it really does look ugly as all hell, but it tastes great! Sometimes they leave it in a little brine to add some flavour, but I was sent off with a little pack of dried seaweed which was all crunchy and salty and was such a treat!&quot;** *Storm could have gone on about why he loved seaweed, and how it was such a core ingredient in many other dishes he enjoyed. He kept it to himself for now though. The experience was better tasted than heard of.* **&quot;How about yours?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-09-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Wow... that&#x27;s a lot of pressure, but I think I can do that for you.&quot;** Hyacinth thought back to all the different outfits she&#x27;d seen Storm in. *If she was going to pick out something new for him to wear, it would have to be something he would like. She hadn&#x27;t seen him wear many shirts, or any shirts really, which was a little unusual. Either he didn&#x27;t like them, or he&#x27;d never found one that fit his broad chest. He might need something a little more formal for special occasions. Did he have pyjamas? A coat for colder weather? Being covered in fur might keep him warm, but as soon as it got wet from rain or melted snow, it must get uncomfortable.* 

She watched him dilute his coffee again, then looked over at her own cup resting on the side table, which was almost empty now. *Breakfast worked out well after all, even if what Storm was drinking was barely coffee now.* She thought, taking another bite of toast. **&quot;What&#x27;s your favourite food?&quot;** Hyacinth asked.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-31</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I&#x27;ll be honest.. I&#x27;m.. not impressed by what I have in my wardrobe right now. I&#x27;d really appreciate your help on overhauling my style.&quot;** *Storm had decided to swallow his pride a little there. He had to admit that his entire wardrobe was lazy, save for the two outfits that were actually tailor-made by weavers he didn&#x27;t screw over while drunk - one of which was the one he wore during the speed dating event. With Hyacinth&#x27;s expertise in fashion, how he looked was bound to be elevated by miles.* **&quot;I hope so too.. I&#x27;ll be putting my appearance in your hands when we go to Waterdeep!&quot;** *The Tabaxi chuckled a little. A part of him felt like he was certainly going to have some trouble when it came to tops, but as long as it was spending time with his beloved Changeling, the fun would be overwhelming anyways. He took another sip of coffee, not grimacing as much, but still adding more and more milk to his mug. His drink resembled coffee less and less as time went on.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-31</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Aww... I won&#x27;t pry. If you&#x27;re comfortable with your shorts, then that&#x27;s all that matters, right?&quot;** Hyacinth understood that he was nervous. *He probably thinks the clothing he&#x27;s got won&#x27;t be up to my standard or something.* **&quot;I&#x27;m sure you could wear anything and pull it off good Sprinkles!&quot;** *She was picturing what he&#x27;d look like in a ruffle collar now. He&#x27;d probably have the same grimace on his face if she dressed him up with one of those... but it would be insanely adorable.* *&quot;You could really pull anything off.&quot;* She muttered, before reaching for a slice of toast and slathering it with jam.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-30</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Azalea? No clue who that is but sure!&quot;** *Storm was happy that Hyacinth seemed to be interested in a little trip to Waterdeep too. It had been some time since he left the guild to have a few days off training and studying about the stars, so this mini-vacation was something he was really excited for, especially after the war.* **&quot;And yeah.. maybe get more coffee in the morning too.. though I&#x27;ll probably need to pack lots of milk with that too.&quot;** *He chuckled a little before grimacing when Hyacinth said she wanted to look into his closet.* **&quot;Uhm.. let&#x27;s just pretend my wardrobe is empty and I need a complete restock?&quot;** *The Tabaxi was going to do a lot to make sure his lover didn&#x27;t see his wardrobe, even go so far as to try whatever outfit she may have been thinking for him to get already.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-29</p> <p class="message">Seeing how excited Storm was becoming at the idea, Hyacinth sat up a little in the bed too. **”That sounds like a wonderful day trip. We could stop by Azalea’s in the morning too. It’s just outside the city. Then a whole day of shopping! If we do that, I’ll have to get to sleep early the day before to make up for a whole night watching the stars.”** Hyacinth looked rather pleased with the idea. She also had a small fortune saved up now from the work she’d been doing around the guild. **”I noticed that you wear a lot of shorts. At some point, can I take a look through your closet? I have to know what we’re working with here!”** If she was going to overhaul Storm’s style, she’d also have to read up on what was fashionable lately on men. *Were ruffled collars still in? Probably, those were a timeless accessory. How about kilts? She’d seen a trash panda wearing one at the guild.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-29</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hm... We could head to Waterdeep early in the morning, arrive before noon, shop til&#x27; we drop, find some good food, then spend the night watching the night sky in a planetarium?&quot;** *Storm&#x27;s ears were jolting up, his tail previously nestled in the blankets now waving about excitedly too. The places Hyacinth mentioned did sound expensive, but the Tabaxi had earned quite a fortune from battling in the nearby fighting pits and gained a small reputation.*

**&quot;Definitely! I need to add more to my wardrobe anyways.. Some new fancy clothes like the one I wore during the dating event could be nice.. could make it my new style rather than just shorts.&quot;** *The Tabaxi cut up another piece of pancake and put it in his mouth, praying to all gods that his lover didn&#x27;t check his wardrobe. The reason she had seen him in the same shorts was because he had multiple of the same shorts. Why? Why not! They were super cheap, felt comfortable, and he was too lazy to keep finding for more! Well.. with Hyacinth now though, he would certainly take more time to find some nice clothes to wear.. likely the grandiose robes similar to the one he wore when they first met, but worn similarly as he still had a dislike to covering his torso up.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-29</p> <p class="message">**”There are several nice shops in Waterdeep. Velatha’s Delights is where you’d go to get a few statement pieces to really make a wardrobe, but there are other fashion design houses like Diamond Dreams in the Trade Ward.”** *Of course, the best shops were all rather expensive. It went hand in hand with their higher status.* Waterdeep was at the cutting edge of fashion trends. It was a big city, and much of the Sword Coast nobility had residences or apartments there.

Hyacinth wondered if Storm might have insinuated that he’d consent to getting new clothes too. She was suddenly excited by the thought. *He must not have very many options... she’d seen him in the same shorts several times over the last week.* **”There are lots of places to buy more basic clothing too.

Sipping some more coffee, she listened as he explained how he pursued his interests in the past. **&quot;You don&#x27;t have to break in to planetariums.

It wasn&#x27;t that he didn&#x27;t feel bad when eating an animal, but justified it as part of the course of nature and the circle of life. Did that way of thinking have its flaws? Likely so, but he respected Hyacinth preferring not to eat meat. He pondered alternating between a vegetarian and normal diet on a weekly basis so he could find out more about it too.* **&quot;Well.. firstly, there&#x27;s no where as comfortable as a bed once you&#x27;ve slept on grass or wood for years.&quot;** *The Tabaxi chuckles a little, the nights of him laying on soft grass and leaves over wood flashing into his mind.

Some days, I&#x27;d fish.. other days, I&#x27;d hunt.. I&#x27;d gather some fruits and root vegetables I could find too.

Strawberries were some of her favourites.

As they continue eating, curiosity prompts her to ask more about Storm’s past. **”What was it like living in the wilderness?”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-24</p> <p class="message">*Storm chuckled a little when Hyacinth scrunched up her face, but doesn’t comment on it further.

The Tabaxi enjoyed every second of it, especially because it was with her.. her who he loved so darned much. He was going to get the tray and bring it to his lap from the bedside table, but stopped when he felt Hyacinth running a hand across his forearm. Storm turned to face her, ears both raised a little in slight confusion.. not understanding for a moment, but realising his disbelief may have flashed on his freckles. The feline turned back to face the Changeling, putting a large paw over her hand on his forearm.. stroking it comfortingly with his thumb.* **&quot;Yeah.. You&#x27;re just..

Now that the platter was out of her hands, Hyacinth leans in and kisses Storm back softly, turning it into a longer affair. *He made the first move this time!*

She loved the way his freckles flashed with every new emotion, but she did notice something new. *Disbelief? She hadn&#x27;t seen him look at her like that before.* **&quot;Is everything alright?&quot;** She asks in a soft tone after releasing the kiss.

*The Tabaxi found it much easier to act before thinking, and supposed that was what got him to do such a thing before his bashful logic would&#x27;ve stopped him. He didn&#x27;t regret that though, enjoying any form of intimate affection he could share with Hyacinth.. and kissed her forehead yet again. Storm loved the natural way the Changeling looked too, in slight disbelief and amazement that his lover looked amazing no matter what.* **&quot;Well then.. I don&#x27;t see why we should delay breakfast in bed any longer~?&quot;** *He chuckled softly while holding Hyacinth&#x27;s hand in his, slowly guiding her to the bed.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-23</p> <p class="message">*Aww!

Hyacinth was beaming with happiness now, knowing he didn&#x27;t feel any different since their activities last night. Those freckles were a give away...  and the way he looked at her too. Her own magical marks had disappeared since last night, when she&#x27;d cast that spell to create the falling stars.

When the Tabaxi heard his lover&#x27;s voice, he finally looked up, freckles and eyes glimmering as he took in her beauty for a while. A part of him wished he could have awoken to her gorgeous face, but the tray of food she was carrying didn&#x27;t go unnoticed. Storm visibly sniffed for a moment, the aroma wafting from the platter the Changeling had prepared for him causing him to salivate already. He quickly closed the book and put it aside, clearly excited as he got up and approached Hyacinth.* **&quot;W-Woah.. this looks amazing..&quot;** *Storm brought his hands up to help his lover hold the tray of food too, but his gaze was focused on hers.. his freckles scintillating with violets.* **&quot;Yeah.. after I got into reading.. waking up earlier just felt better I guess?

On the platter, she’s got a full breakfast spread arranged in a way that she had to be careful not to mess up. It must have taken some effort to get it up the steps to the rooms without spilling the coffee.

She didn’t think she’d been gone for too long, so Hyacinth was surprised to find the room a bit tidier than when she’d tiptoed out earlier in the morning. There were less books to trip on. Only after noticing this did she realize that Storm was awake. She almost had a little panic when he wasn’t in bed until she saw he just moves to his couch to read. For a moment, Hyacinth thought that her breakfast in bed had been ruined. **”Oh! There you are...

He frowned a little when he fluttered his eyes open to not find his lover there, at first thinking it was all a fantastical dream. The Tabaxi could smell her still on his sheets and blanket though, and that earned a sigh from him. After a little stretching, he finally climbed out of bed, scratching his mane a little as he approached the window. He cast his lilac gaze out.. just standing there to enjoy the morning scenery for a few minutes before heading off.. exiting his room to clean up the books and food left on the roof the previous night.*

*After a bit, he would return.. a little bashful after the librarian told him off a little about constantly forgetting to bring back loaned books. Storm promised to return the rest sooner than later, and sighed as he re-entered his room. The Tabaxi still held a few books and piles of notes which he was studying last night though, and decided to get on his couch.. splaying the texts out in front of him before getting back to studying more about the stars, the Weave, and how they were connected.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-21</p> <p class="message">Hyacinth awoke first in the morning, wriggling out from under Storm; a task made a bit easier given her natural shapeshifting ability.

The Tabaxi didn&#x27;t mind not having any covers as she stole them, his fur serving as natural protection anyways. Besides, he still had her in his arms.. and the warmth they shared was all he needed to stay comfortable.

If it meant she would snuggle up more to him, he wouldn&#x27;t say no anytime even though it made him bashful.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-21</p> <p class="message">**&quot;It&#x27;s late... but we could... no... you&#x27;ve been through a lot today.&quot;** *Take your own advice Hya and let the man sleep.* She straightens a bit under the sheets, turning to lie on her back and taking the pressure off of Storm, physically and... intimately. His arm is still trapped though. He&#x27;s not getting that paw back tonight.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-21</p> <p class="message">*The adorable nickname he accepted despite how incredulous it would seem for outsiders brought a flicker of light surging through her freckles. It certainly lightened the mood, even if it brought memories of his close brush with death. Another reason why he loved Hyacinth. She helped him get back from the brink of death with Tharnam, and he would be ever thankful towards the two - though more so to the Changeling as she was his lover after all.* **&quot;We.. we do.. I&#x27;d like that..&quot;** *Storm kissed the back of her head, though his eyes immediately widened with shock as she wiggled her rear over his pelvis. Now that his attention was fully on it, it was certainly a little erotic to say the least.* **&quot;I.. not uncomfortable.. but.. but I&#x27;m afraid I may.. you know.. guys.. guys can get uhm.. &#x27;excited&#x27;.. but I don&#x27;t want to push that kind of thing..&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-21</p> <p class="message">She could feel the rumble in his throat when he spoke softly to her. It was almost like a purr. **&quot;I know how you feel. You won&#x27;t ruin it Sprinkles. I&#x27;ll point you in the right direction.&quot;** She replies, using the cute name she picked for him on their quest together. **&quot;We just... need time... to figure each other out. ** Hyacinth hoped she&#x27;d figure out how to talk to him without the two of them blushing like school children. **&quot;For a start; does this...&quot;** She wiggles her butt **&quot;Make you uncomfortable?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-21</p> <p class="message">Storm let out a shaky sigh as he thought to himself for a moment. His ears picked up Hyacinth stumbling on her own words, realising that this act of intimacy got both of them anxious. The Tabaxi shook his head, though realising a few seconds after that she wasn&#x27;t looking at him and wouldn&#x27;t be able to see him. Storm resolved to nuzzling into the top of Hyacinth&#x27;s head, muscular arms holding on to her a little tighter. There were likely still *those* thoughts in his mind, of progressing such intimacy between them, but he himself was too tired and knew that he would much rather have a genuine and affectionate cuddle with Hyacinth instead of needlessly rushing things. **&quot;It&#x27;s fine, Rainbow.. Just.. I&#x27;ve never.. slept with anyone else before.. and.. and I don&#x27;t want to ruin this.. or make you uncomfortable.. so if I do, please tell me.. I want to do everything I can correctly.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-21</p> <p class="message">Hyacinth couldn&#x27;t see Storm blushing from her position, but she could feel his heart pounding ferociously. *Was he afraid, anxious? First time with a girl in his bed? Maybe this level of intimacy wasn&#x27;t what he needed now.* She could tell something was up. **&quot;You know... you can be open with me... about... stuff.&quot;** She says softly into the pillows. **&quot;I-If talking would help to calm your nerves.&quot;** The only sign of Hyacinth&#x27;s own jitters was the unsureness in her voice when she spoke. She WAS tired, but if he needed it, she&#x27;d stay awake all night to listen.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-20</p> <p class="message">The soft kiss caused his freckles to flicker vibrantly along with the glimmer in his dilated lilac eyes again, causing him to chuckle a little awkwardly while tucking herself under the blankets along with Hyacinth. The Tabaxi gulped as she turned and pressed her back against his chest, already beginning to feel his heart racing. Storm didn&#x27;t care that the Changeling&#x27;s hair was in his face, instead rather enjoying the scent if her shampoo while sponing her. She would likely be able to hear his heart thundering when she pressed her rear against him though, Storm mentally screaming as he tightened his arm around her waist to keep her there. It would certainly take quite some restraint not to get overly aroused. The Tabaxi would be lying if he said he had never thought of being much more intimate with Hyacinth, but he shook that thought out of his head for now as it wasn&#x27;t helpful. Storm sighed softly as he simply focused on making his lover comfortable, smiling when she seemed to snuggle into him while the blanket covered them.. indeed creating a pseudo-nest where their warmths mingled comfortably. **&quot;I love you too..&quot;** Storm could feel himself blushing through his freckles again as he gave her a little squeeze back. He was going to need a lot more practice before he stopped being bashful while saying that.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-20</p> <p class="message">She did wish to hold him. Hyacinth reaches out to Storm, wrapping her arms around him once again and reaching up to plant another soft kiss on his cheek, only noticing the colour changes of his freckles when she was close to the handsome tabaxi in the dim light. **”Goodnight Storm.”** She shifts around on the bed and tucks herself under the blankets and waiting for him to do the same. She wasn’t shy at all about it. When he does, Hyacinth pulls herself in closer, pushing her white-skinned back into his broad chest and moving Storm’s arm so it was draped over her hips. She liked being the little spoon, but hoped that all that pink hair in Storm’s face wouldn’t bother him too much. *I could always shift to a shorter hairstyle...* She thought, *But he loves me the way I am.* That made her smile wider. 

To elevate the cuddle session to dangerous arousal levels and try to smooth out some of their nervousness, Hyacinth tactically rested with the curve of her butt pressing up against Storm’s pelvis. *It was going to take a lot of restraint to make it through tonight.* She thought. Hyacinth shifted a little to settle into the position. Between the sheets and the big hunky kitten, she had made herself a cozy little nest in which to drift off to sleep. **”I love you.”** Hyacinth gives Storm’s arm a little squeeze.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-20</p> <p class="message">As the Tabaxi finished cleaning up, if you could call stacking books and papers near the study table instead of leaving them around everywhere really cleaning up, he glances over to Hyacinth again. He visibly gulps, his adam&#x27;s apple bobbing a little as he took in the sight of his lover calling for him from his bed. Storm could feel the sheepishness bubble within him again, his freckles flickering through spectrums of violet as he watched the Changeling for a moment. The way her hair was splayed out on his bed, how she still looked so god darned gorgeous even without her accessories, and the way she looked at him. That and the grabby hands. *How could someone be so hot and cute at the same time?*

Storm obliges and slowly approaches her, getting on to the bed and shifting closer to his lover.. letting her hold on to him if he wished while he gently wrapped an arm around her waist. He&#x27;d normally sleep in the nude, just as he did in the wild, too, but he didn&#x27;t mind needing to be dressed somewhat decently if it meant he could cuddle with her to sleep. *It&#x27;s an absolute win!* He uses his astral arms to get the lights down darker until they were turned off, so the only illumination left in the room was the moonlight filtered through the lace curtain behind the blackout one which was still open. The Tabaxi took a deep inhale before nuzzling Hyacinth for a moment, enjoying her proximity. She soothed him in ways he didn&#x27;t understand.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-08-19</p> <p class="message">Hyacinth clings to Storm, not really minding the state of his room. It wasn&#x27;t her mess, so it didn&#x27;t bother her. **&quot;It smells like a tea shop in here.&quot;** She says as he brings the both of them inside and closes the door.

When he sits her down on the bed and turns to clean up a little, Hyacinth goes to wrap her own arms around herself to try and trap some of the escaping body heat. *There were a lot more papers and notes strewn about since the last time she&#x27;d been in here.* She quietly observes. She wanted to tell him not to worry about it, but he probably wouldn&#x27;t have cleaned anything otherwise. The changeling takes her mystery crystal into her left hand and activates its strange heating property, causing the colours in the gem to swirl around as it warms her up.

In her own bed, Hyacinth would&#x27;ve slept in the nude, but here she settles on unzipping her boots and folding them up at the foot of the bed. Then she begins taking off her larger pieces of jewellery and sets them aside on the bedside table. Then she ran her fingers through her hair, teasing out the soft pink waves. Ready for bed, she stretches out to Storm, doing grabby hand motions toward him.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-08-19</p> <p class="message">Storm still held on to Hyacinth tightly as he stopped by the front of his door. His astral arms detached from his physical ones, the starry hands reaching into his pockets before protruding a room key. A nebulous hand slides the key in, and swiftly turns the knob. As the door to his room opens, the smell of old paper, tea, coffee, and a mix of spices wafts out. Whatever he was doing here, he sure as hell was busy while doing it. As he enters while still carrying his beloved Changeling, one of his astral arms shuts the door behind. The Tabaxi lays Hyacinth on the bed first, which was really the only thing in order still. The rest of the room was littered with piles of books, stacked papers, and drawings of sorts. His nebulous limbs begin trying to put them aside neatly, though in the dim light of his room, and his focus on Hyacinth as he takes a seat on the bedside, the astral arms were not efficient at all.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-08-19</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Storm just held her hand for a while, savouring the comforting warmth of her hand for a moment before slowly bringing her to the &lt;#686778793003843607&gt;.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">Taking his large paw in her own dainty hand, she says: **&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t say fun... but maybe I learned something about myself... lead the way.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Grown.. yeah definitely!

**&quot;Oh! You left your door open... so... &quot;** She lets the subject drop, not wanting to explain why she was in his room.

 **&quot;I&#x27;d like that.

I was just about to go looking for you... I would have never guessed the library.&quot;** Hyacinth smiles her unusually disarming smile. **&quot;I want to tell you** ***all*** **about my trip.&quot;** As she says this, she thinks back on the events, trying to decide where to begin. *She&#x27;d gone to the kitchen with Cecil to get extra rations at the outset of the journey.* Thinking about the food reminded her she hadn&#x27;t had breakfast. **&quot;Have you had lunch yet? I haven&#x27;t eaten since yesterday.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Right as Hyacinth turned to leave after closing the door though, the sounds of swift footsteps echoed from down the hallway. Emerging from the well lit hallway was the 7 and a half foot tall Tabaxi, in nothing but simple sweatpants. Though he was topless, his bare front was hidden behind the stack of books he was carrying in front of himself, nearly tall enough to block his vision. Storm was whistling softly when he reached the hallway.. but stopped.. completely freezing when he saw Hyacinth.*

*The feline&#x27;s ears and tail twitched out a little before he began to sprint towards her, almost dropping a book or two along the way. When he reached her, he put the books down on the floor as he heaved.. taking deep breaths as his deep purple irises swirled while his freckles flashed luminously. After a few more moments of catching his breath, a smile grew on his face as he brought his gaze up to meet Hyacinth&#x27;s.* **&quot;Hey! Hyacinth! I haven&#x27;t seen you in quite a while!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Right. He&#x27;d mentioned his interest in the stars before. I guess it&#x27;s a serious fascination.* Hyacinth decides to make sure to remember that fascination. Maybe she could go stargazing with him or get a star officially named after him as a gift, from the Stargazer Academy in Waterdeep. *Was that too tacky?*

She was also a bit surprised to see the two books hidden at the bottom of the nest of blankets. *She had known he liked to drink, but it must have been a major problem for him to be seeking self-help books for it. Whatever the case was, she wasn&#x27;t going to let that colour her opinion of him negatively. She didn&#x27;t know him that well, and maybe the books were helping.*

Placing the books back in a neat stack next to the blankets, Hyacinth leaves Storm&#x27;s room, closing the door behind her. *If he hadn&#x27;t locked his door, he probably wasn&#x27;t far.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*The room was indeed devoid of any Tabaxi Hyacinth was looking for. As the Changeling decides to sate her curiosity, she finds a little over a dozen books, each seemingly about a random thing. There were a few about stars and constellations.. others about romance.. and a few others about fantasy. There were more hidden under the blankets upon closer inspection.. but there was no obvious theme.. well.. one. All the covers had pretty stars, or some sort of depiction of the vast galaxy overhead Storm loved dearly. There was even one book which was likely chosen purely because the author&#x27;s name had &#x27;Galaxy&#x27; in it!*

*More and more layers of blankets hid more and more books, like an odd Jenga tower of bound text and comfy cloths. At the bottom of it all though, were two books. No stars. No constellations. No depictions of galaxies. Plain hardcovers, with simple writing. &#x27;The Craving Mind&#x27; and &#x27;The Noonday Demon, and How to Battle It&#x27;*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hello? Calm Before the Storm?&quot;** Hyacinth peeks into the room to see if he&#x27;s in, but doesn&#x27;t want to intrude on his space. Seeing no sign of the tabaxi, she turns to leave, before second guessing herself. *Storm liked to read?* She admitted to being a little curious what sorts of books he was reading. *Nonfiction? Fantasy? maybe he&#x27;s a fan of a good mystery novel?* She peeks in one more time to look for any sign of him, before going further in to look at the books.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#9755ff">Mythirios#0008</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*As Hyacinth knocked on the door, it seemed to open slightly.. as if it wasn&#x27;t locked nor was it closed properly. The slightly ajar door gave her line of sight into the gently illuminated room.. only the overhead light and rays of sun streaming through barely opened curtains lit the room to an oddly comfortable level of brightness.*

*At the far end of the room, on the couch chair right next to the curtained window, was a sight which contrasted the otherwise extremely orderly room. Upon it were several blankets thrown carelessly over it, with thick books peaking out here and there. There are mugs left by the chair&#x27;s side as well, though if Hyacinth chose to enter and take a closer look, would find were empty.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Storybored#0001</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">At some point in the mid-morning, Hyacinth sets off down the hall to knock gently on Storm&#x27;s door. *If he&#x27;s not here... he might be in the arena.
