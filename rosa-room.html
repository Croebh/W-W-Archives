I&#x27;m born to a half-elf mother and Human father, a humble cleric-hunter and woodsman couple. I had a rather happy childhood, that is until the plague swept the Hollow. I was among the very few who survived, and I was also the one who had to dig the graves for my parents and dozens of other villagers.&quot;** She pauses slightly, reflecting on her latest recklessness that almost caused the loss of two lives. **&quot;At the start of my pregnancy I embarked on an investigation to the old hamlet I called home, only to find out it had been festered by Tiamat&#x27;s influence and I have a sister abducted by the Dragon Queen. A shadow dragon almost take me and my child to death, but praise Bahamut I could still stand and ended the infestation with Glenda and my dearest members of Ashflower Guild.&quot;** 

**&quot;But still, I believe everyone shouldn&#x27;t have to go through the hazing of tragic history to be wise. And if ever, I wish no one ever need to experience sorrow in their lives. Hardships can make someone wise--or even more spiteful and reckless. No one would know.&quot;** She clutches the platinum Bahamut symbol pinning her cloak.  **I&#x27;m thankful Bahamut guides me through the dark days to be what I am today.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#da66ff">Primelord#4601</p><p class="time">2021-07-18</p> <p class="message">*she nods smiling slightly* **&quot;your only 20?

But to determine that there would be thorough physical examination undergone on him.&quot;** That doesn&#x27;t sound like a satisfying answer, but Rosa doesn&#x27;t want to hide anything. **&quot;If you really want to conceive a child sired by Sir Asital, there are always magical means and rituals you could look to.

Yuan-Ti purebloods, according to some, are actually closer to humanoids that share traits with Humans rather than serpents themselves. But with him conceived from an hatched egg, I can&#x27;t be sure how much this is true.&quot;** She taps her fingers on the book, mulling deeply.  **&quot;Also, because you and Sir Asital hasn&#x27;t done...ummm that, I can&#x27;t be sure if his parts down there functions following the biology of gestating humanoids or egg-laying serpents and dragonborns. That being said...&quot;**

There might be some solutions to that hiding somewhere. But it is most likely embarassing, hard to wrap one&#x27;s mind around, and/or just blatantly balsphemous.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#da66ff">Primelord#4601</p><p class="time">2021-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;If it helps.....I&#x27;m a assimar kinda the reason I was taken&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#da66ff">Primelord#4601</p><p class="time">2021-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;.......by egg&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2021-07-18</p> <p class="message">Rosa laughs and waves her hand lightly. **&quot;I know well what you&#x27;re talking about.

There Weisslogia goes again. Making Weisslogia able to speak with someone she has just met, and doesn&#x27;t have a positive first impression for, is a grave mistake. **&quot;That applies to you too, Weisslogia.

**&quot;I&#x27;m sorry again for her. Some kind of arrogance and short temper seems to run among some folks with draconic blood in Ashflower Guild.

Though she does think the other woman should fix and soften her way with words, otherwise others would be more prone to misunderstand her.

**&quot;It&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s not less exciting!&quot;** Weisslogia cackles. **&quot;But in my past life, fighting dragons was like dayjob from me. I was a white dragon, and you know what they said about them, being the stupidest and runt of the litter among other dragons. But Bahamut saw the potential in me and offered a better way to life, on top of him bestowing me valor and wisdom beyond ordinary dragons, and exalted me as his loyal zealot!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#da66ff">WitherthePlant#9575</p><p class="time">2021-05-31</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Heheh...sulking is replaced with just being irritated for me.

She looks around and found the sun has just set and illuminated a white Bahamut bust in golden hue. Oh, so she&#x27;s in Rosa&#x27;s room, with the cleric on her worktable making some drink and her asshole brother reading in one corner.

**&quot;Good to see you wake up, Sig.&quot;** Rosa smiles. **&quot;Come on get ready. Tann said you have a date tonight. I prepared the berry punch for your date.&quot;**

**&quot;I still found it hard to believe the owlish girl--Strix--actually agreed to go on a date with you,&quot;** says Tannhäuser. **&quot;And no, Rosa, I know Summer Court Berry Punch calls for elven wine, but don&#x27;t add it.&quot;**

**&quot;Oh come on you know elven wine is nothing strong like dwarven mead! A little of it won&#x27;t spike the punch! Wine is what make or breaks the Summer Court Punch!&quot;** Sigrun huffs, less so of an annoyance and more of dismay. Rosa looks at Tannhäuser and he sighs and gestures her to go on and add some elven wine to the punch.

**&quot;Still can&#x27;t believe you scored a date with Strix though,&quot;** Rosa giggles. **&quot;But you got her approval consensually right? No charm person or anything?&quot;**

**&quot;She kissed me first, okay? Okay, more like a peck but still she started it! And I did nothing creepy!&quot;** Tannhäuser looks at her in disbelieve and groans. **&quot;Oh, c&#x27;mon, Tann, I know I&#x27;m a bitch but not a creep! Oh goodness i passed out from your suplex that now I have no time for my looks.&quot;**

**&quot;Knowing Strix, she probably doesn&#x27;t mind as long as you&#x27;re being a decent courteous woman.&quot;** Rosa fills the basket with the punch and treats and gives it to Sigrun. **&quot;Good luck with your date!&quot;**

Sigrun chuckles and winks. **&quot;It&#x27;s full moon tonight. I have Sehanine&#x27;s blessing, not Corellon&#x27;s curse! Anyways, I got a little owl waiting at the lake! See ya!&quot;** She climbs the window and jumps.

Rosa waves then looks at Tannhäuser. **&quot;Does she ever actually use the door like a normal person?&quot;**

**&quot;What makes you think Sigrun is even a normal person,&quot;** he replies flatly.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-03</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Staticstasis#1063</p><p class="time">2020-10-31</p> <p class="message">*Glenda happily cuddles her close as she smirks*

**&quot;ha... I can get sick. Just depends when. And of course I&#x27;ll feed you&quot;**

She would love to lean and have Glenda cuddle her, but alas she can&#x27;t do that. **&quot;True but still... I still can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;d ever see you being weak or sick. You&#x27;re just, you look really strong, you know. Unlike me.&quot;** She shivers softly and pulls her red cloak closer to her body. **&quot;Uhh... You really think I&#x27;m cute with my hair down? I mean, it&#x27;s kind of getting in the way in battle but if you like it better... I&#x27;ll wear it down more often...&quot;** She plays with her hair and quickly combs her hair with her fingers and make her hair and herself looks more presentable. **&quot;I-I know this is embarrassing but can you help feed me?&quot;** she fidgets, embarrassed to ask Glenda to treat her like a child, but yet at the same time she wants to be pampered by her white wolf in times like this.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Staticstasis#1063</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">*Glenda would  catch the spoon and gently set it down as she shakes her head. She would put her tail close agaisnt Rosa as she smiles*
**&quot;its ok. Everyone has their weak or sick moments&quot;**
*She would start to slowly offer to feed Rosa as she keeps close*
**&quot;still don&#x27;t mind me saying this but you look pretty cute with your hair down&quot;**
*Glenda comments as she keeps closer*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">Rosa snorts and blinks. Her eyes feels so bleary and she could barely breath through her congested nose. Even breathing and keeping her eyes open feels like something so miserable to do. She barely registers the tray with hot food placd on her lap. But she know well when her lover sits by her bed, and she couldn&#x27;t help but feeling warm (in a good way) when her lover pets her hair gently. **&quot;Thank you. You&#x27;re really sweet, my white wolf,&quot;** she giggles softly and reaches to caress Glenda&#x27;s cheek. She&#x27;d love to give her lover a kiss, but it&#x27;s impossible with her being sick and all. She slowly eat the warm creamy soup, tasting the gentle deliciousness that ease her symptoms of discomfort even just for a bit. **&quot;It&#x27;s embarrassing to have you see me being sick amd weak like this... Especially when I&#x27;m a cleric and a healer...&quot;** She winces softly as her head pounds again amd makes her drop the spoon.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Staticstasis#1063</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">*Glenda would look Rosa over taking note first of how she seem to be in slight pain from getting up. Next was how she sounded weak. That wouldn&#x27;t do, Glenda thought. She walks over after closing the door and pulls a chair over as she held the tray with soup and straw berries*
**&quot;its alright. You needed the rest yeah? Just make you you get plenty of rest and get better. Now... I got some soup and strawberries here&quot;**
*Glenda says softly as she balances the tray on her lap. She would reach out and gently pet Rosa smiling*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">Rosa whines softly under her blanket. She turns around to see who&#x27;s coming and she brightens up (not that you can see it from her feverish red face ) when Glenda comes in. Her red hair which usually tied to a loose ponytail is let completely loose, crimson strands strewn wildly while some stuck to her forehead from the sweat. **&quot;Oh, you&#x27;re here dear,&quot;** she smiles softly, her voice comes out weaker than usual. **&quot;I&#x27;m sorry I haven&#x27;t told you I&#x27;m sick. Ever since coming back from arena yesterday my condition got worse really quick.&quot;** She tries to sits up, whimpering softly when a strike of headache hits again. **&#x27;T-thank you for checking up on...ah...achoooo!&quot;** She sneezes and quickly grabs the tissue on the bedside table.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Staticstasis#1063</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">*Glenda looks at the tray then nods. Time to be the care doggo! She would enter in as she peaks in*
**&quot;A certain bird might have told me you gotten sick love&quot;**
*She smiles as she walks towards Rosa*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Yep. Catching a terrible cold after got two giants or whatever hurling their icy snot on her,&quot;** Sigrun shakes her head softly. She grins and gently shoves the tray to Glenda&#x27;s hand. **&quot;Well, you&#x27;re her girlfriend so you&#x27;re the best person to take care of her! Remember be careful with the soup, and don&#x27;t you dare eat the strawberries! It&#x27;s her favorite and poor girl needs it all to recover!&quot;** She knocks the door with three firm knock and got a reply of a sneeze and a weak &quot;C-Come in...!&quot; from inside. **&quot;Good luck kiddo! Rosa will appreciate to have a caring girlfriend to take care of her.&quot;** She pats Glenda&#x27;s back and gives the shifter two-finger salute then blitz away to Oghma-knows-where.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Staticstasis#1063</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">**&quot;oi I was looking for her so I was looking else where not her room&quot;**

**&quot;She sick or something?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Holy shit that arena is fucking cursed. Not only I always got my ass kicked royally there, now Rosa is getting a bad flu from a giant&#x27;s icy snot...&quot;** Sigrun just come from the guild hall with a tray of hot soup and sliced strawberries for Rosa. Dang, she thought being a cleric means you&#x27;re virtually free for any sickness as you can just poof it away with the divine magic. Seems that she&#x27;s wrong. She&#x27;s surprised by the sight of white wolf ears on top of long wild mane of silvery snow, standing in front of Rosa&#x27;s room. **&quot;Hey white wolfy! About time you visit your sick girlfriend!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Staticstasis#1063</p><p class="time">2020-10-29</p> <p class="message">*Glenda would walk to Rosa&#x27;s room pondering why she isn&#x27;t around as often.  She would think being a helpful person she wohld be out and about. All well, that&#x27;s why she&#x27;s there. To visit her dears wouldful Rosa*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-10-22</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-19</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Right, that should do.&quot;** Rosa hums happily as she caps the bottle filled of potion for cold. After she&#x27;s made 2 more, she&#x27;ll sell it to nearest town. She closes her medicine book and put it back to the shelf, when suddenly the window bursts open. A tall, lanky figure sits there, wild snow white hair holds together in elven-style hairdo, eyes of crystal blue and lightning amber shine under a wide grin.

**&quot;Sup, Lil Rosa!&quot;**

**S-S-Sigrun?&quot;** Rosa gasps with her eyes wide. **&quot;Sigrun is that you? Why are you here--wait, no, how in Bahamut&#x27;s name you&#x27;re here?! This place is only for guild members! You&#x27;ll be in trouble!&quot;**

**&quot;Why I&#x27;m here? For you, of course, baby rose!&quot;** The elf pokes Rosa&#x27;s nose. **&quot;And for pretty ladies too!  Hey, this guild got lots of cute girls right, right, right?&quot;**

**&quot;I&#x27;m happy to see you around but--!&quot;** Before she knew it, the elf already jumps down the window and disappears to Oghma-knows-where. If Sigrun is here, that means Tannhäuser would also be around, sooner or later. Rosa sighs, knowing this guild is in for the chaotic shenanigans brought by the elder Eisfell. She loves Sigrun and sees her as her own big sister, but seriously the rogue elf has &quot;Trouble&quot; as her mid-name. She goes downstairs to see if she has to do something to mitigate Sigrun&#x27;s chaos. And, oh. No. *Oh no*. The women of Ashflower Guild is in for a hell--for the infamous disaster womanizer is here!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-11</p><p class="message">It takes some time, but Rosa finally be able to furnish and set her room to her liking. She appreciates the fact that the wall has blue and silver wallpaper on it, suiting the colours of Bahamut faith. Other than that it&#x27;s a simple of tasteful room, with magical lantern that would let her to read and study overnight without needing to change the candle. Her books of medicine, religious studies and compendium of heroic legends neatly set on the shelf. She found her way to procure a good quality of Bahamut bust statue for her to make a personal altar for her daily prayers and meditations.

&quot;Well, this is going to be my new home for now,&quot; she huffs softly and drops herself to the plush bed. A nap would be heavenly. She needs to gather all bearings after a long journey, and probably taking that job to Loudwater tomorrow is a good idea...</p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/764342423026794526/764639966642569246/20201011065530_1.jpg"/></li>
