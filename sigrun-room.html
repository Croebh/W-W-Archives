There&#x27;s an owl&#x27;s hooting noise coming, and slowly but sure the outline of a snowy owl appears.

Then poof. Here&#x27;s Ventus.

**&quot;Buddy!&quot;** Sigrun hugs her owl--the familiar one, not the girlfriend one--and smooches him. **&quot;I&#x27;m so sorry for being a jerk, but I miss you!&quot;**

Stop. STOP. This is not horni time. Go to the horni jail, Sigrun! Bonk! You&#x27;re here to get your best birb friend back!

**&quot;Ugh...hngh, okay, no horni time for now,&quot;** she mumbles with a slight pout, with a look that kind of give a vibe that she&#x27;s high (even when she&#x27;s not). **&quot;Yeah, he&#x27;s a familiar so I can get him back.

But of course, she has the reason for it. What is victory if she lost Ventus, her best bird buddy? Not that she lost him permanently as he is a familiar easily summoned back, but still! Still! It&#x27;s the loss that counts! She sighs and enters her room which also already becoming her owl girlfriend&#x27;s nest. **&quot;Strix, babe~!

Rosa decided to stay behind with her lover, sobbing quietly, and just give him spare key yo Sigrun&#x27;s room to do whatever he pleases. He personally thinks that is not something to cry over with, as even greatest warriors do often taste defeat, but Rosa is a gentle person. He knows well the cleric never expected herself to be able to triumph over the ferocious fierce white wolf, let alone pounding her until she was deeply unconscious.

When the midnight strikes Sigrun comes in with a smile. Not a cocky one, or the stupid grin one, but one that just feel oddly gentle. **&quot;You look happy, sister. I take that your date with Strix went well?&quot;**

He expects her to laughs and grins, then proceeds to boast about her date and what an elegant lover she is. He&#x27;s taken quite off guard when Sigrun only offers a smile. No fanfare. No boasting her latest lady she has just conquered. Not even getting upset and throwing tantrum on why he&#x27;s here in her personal territory and being a nosy loser. She just straight up loosening her hair from her braid and half-ponytail then head to the bed. How strange.

Really really strange. In one day he has just seen what people in love could do. At times it will make you cry for your loved one. The other times it might make you shed your shallow superficiality. Such one colourful night of full moon.

Sehanine is not a goddess of love, but he couldn&#x27;t help but wondering if the mistress of the moonlight played part in this. Who would ever know? He chuckles inside the moonlit room and relaxes himself to the sofa and takes his nightly rest. He prays to Sehanine her moonlight would show him the way in this world, just like how it does to the lovers basking on her grace.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-11-07</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-26</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Heyo Rosa, come to hang out with your awesome elf big sis?&quot;** Sigrun is lounging on the fancy sofa and waves at Rosa entering her room.

Sigrun huffs. **&quot;I mean I want to, but man, women of this guild is sure hard to get...&quot;** Rosa chuckles and shakes her head.**&quot;By the way, Sig, I was on my way back from my job at apothecary when I see a tall elf man in armor with a greatsword. I think it&#x27;s Tannhäuser.&quot;**

**&quot;Tann... T-Tannhäuser? He&#x27;s coming?&quot;**

Rosa shrugs. **&quot;I didn&#x27;t get to talk with him as he already rode away before I got to approach him. If it&#x27;s really him, probably he&#x27;s just in Sword Coast for Knights in Silver duty--wait, Sigrun, what are you doing?&quot;**

Sigrun already climbs the window, now squatting on the frame ready to take a jump. **&quot;I don&#x27;t fucking care if it&#x27;s him or whatever the fuck he&#x27;s doing around here, but he will never ever get meeee.....!&quot;**

And so the elf rogue jumps out of the window and flees to wherever the chaotic wind blows. Rosa giggles and shakes her head. Now the Eisfell Lions are both here, things in the guild surely will be more interesting. She wonders if it could mean a storm is brewing in the air, however.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">fazadragonhart#1240</p><p class="time">2020-10-25</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/768635645685399572/769718486657138708/d914cc345316d82d203b66773d1e50da.png"/></li>
