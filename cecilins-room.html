How long has ice cream been an important dessert?&quot; *He asked, continuing to stroll down the guild halls with his dearest soul blade beside him.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-08-08</p> <p class="message">*Kaarlo looks up and smiles.  as she speaks she makes ice cream sound like the 2nd best thing in the world* **&quot;Welllll Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients, that has been frozen into a soft, creamy delight.  That is what this book is for!&quot;** *She shows Cecil the book she is holding the words.  Ice cream for beginners*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#da66ff">IndecisiveHalfling#6594</p><p class="time">2020-08-08</p> <p class="message">*After a couple paces, Cecil noticed he was walking a little fast for the tiefling, consciously slowing down a bit to accommodate her. Strange, he thought, he never had someone to walk beside him before that he would ever consider slowing down for. But here he was, and it felt much more natural than he&#x27;d anticipated.* &quot;Tell me again, how do they make this ice... cream?&quot;</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-08-08</p> <p class="message">*Kaarlo smiles as she takes his arm and puts the book she was holding in her other hand.* **&quot;Well....there is a few spots.  There is the guild hall?  I believe they put in a new booth just for people to relax in.  So let&#x27;s head down there!&quot;** *She begins to lead the way trying to keep in pace of her more long legged boyfriend*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#da66ff">IndecisiveHalfling#6594</p><p class="time">2020-08-08</p> <p class="message">&quot;Ah yes, that dessert you were telling me about in the High Ice!&quot; *Cecil remembers, his expression melting into a loving grin as he realized there wasn&#x27;t anything wrong... at least so far. The knock had startled him at first, however.* &quot;I&#x27;d love to. Where do we find it?&quot; *He backs up into his room a little more, snatching up his cloak from a hook beside the door and tossing it over his shoulders. The sorcerer offered his arm to Kaarlo, smiling back at her and feeling thankful for this specific kind of interruption to his studies.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-08-08</p> <p class="message">*Kaarlo is holding a book as she looks at her boyfriend* **&quot;So....wanna get some ice cream?&quot;** *She smiles up to the twink and looks so happy to see him again*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#da66ff">IndecisiveHalfling#6594</p><p class="time">2020-08-07</p> <p class="message">*Cecil looks up from his notebook quickly, the pages still damp with ink as he stands to open the door. His brows are knitted together as he swings it open. Cecil&#x27;s expression softens in a moment but retains its curious undertone.* &quot;Oh, hello.
