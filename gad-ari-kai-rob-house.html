She was everything to him, every piece of happiness and joy in his life! He wanted her as badly as his wife as she wanted him as her husband! And he would be that for her!

A lot more things. All while telling him how much she loved him. How much she wanted to be with him forever. How much he had helped her figure out who she was. How much he had helped her through the hardest parts of her life. How much she couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of loosing him or not being with him. She wanted to be his best friend. His lover. The mother of his children. The person he could trust with any and everything. She wanted to be to him what he had been to her. And all that boiled down to one thing:*

*She wanted to be his wife, and he her husband.*

That&#x27;s....woah. Wait...the ignition chamber would strain the crystal, right? What if...what if the same could be done with a crystal or gemstone? One that was constantly able to grow even while it was being broken down by the chamber. The calibration would require some pretty precise math and it would need a very special type of stone...something to research later. For now though LET ME SEE THIS THING!!!&quot;** *Gadget looks over the launchers, switching each setting back and forth, making a note especially of the display. She was already getting idea of how to upgrade her Bolter, knowing she could cut down on some of her gear by compressing some of the basic functions into the magigun.* **&quot;I&#x27;ve been working on gem frequency connectivity.

They collect and store magical energy directly from the weave to sustain and reproduce themselfs. Pure magical energy contained within that can be harvested and used.No sideeffects for the Algea themselfs.&quot;** *He says and pulls out another cylinder from a compartment on the armors hip and brings it over to the gun, waving Gadget over.* **&quot;This is the weave ignition chamber.&quot;** *He says, pointing at the chamber where the other cylinder was in before.* **&quot;It uses the stored magicsl energy in the algea and converts it into whatever you need.

It was a very interesting design, for sure, and she understand the principal behind it relatively easily. Hearing about the ignition chamber gets her thinking about possibly using some form of external drive; one that was easier to maintain on the fly. No, that would just be taking the problem and working around it. She needed a solution...wait.* **&quot;What if instead of one large drive we used several smaller ones. That way the strain wouldn&#x27;t be as great on a single crystal. You would still need high quality gems, but they wouldn&#x27;t be under as much strain...&quot;** *She ponders this, going around the armor to look at the weave ignition chamber it sported to see what improvements could be made in theory.

Building it Piecemeal is good... I need to get my hands on plate myself at some point but... Getting one out of adamantine is a big yikes...&quot;** *He says.* **&quot;You can use the gauntlets magic to infuse the whole armor with it. Giving you a bit more stability.

She slipped on the glove, the gem glowing in sync with the one in her bolter which lay on the table in front of her. She walked over to a punching bag and made a fist, electricity sparks between the metal knuckle caps as she swung. The punch let loose arcs of lightning into the bag, searing it.

Despite the only thing they feel toward Gadget right being gratitude, Cinder only briefly hugs her back, brushes her off and gets up. **&quot;I&#x27;m sorry, Gadget&quot;** they say **&quot;but I think I need some alone time to process this&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-07</p> <p class="message">*Gadget saw this and scooted closer, putting her arm around Cinder and holding them tight.

I&#x27;m not going to say that&#x27;s the case but...even if he was...that wouldn&#x27;t make it okay for him to manipulate you. To treat you like some kind of pet.&quot;** *She held on tighter, a sadness crossing her face as a memory gripped at her heart.* **&quot;I had a friend...her name was Annie. I...I hadn&#x27;t seen her in years and yet this bastard named Orcus transformed her into a bodak and tried to use her to come after me. I don&#x27;t know how he found out about me, or how I was related to Maretta, his enemy. But he did...he he went after her. Guys like that...they find ways to learn about you. Find ways to get at you. To use whatever they can to...to hurt you.&quot;** *Gadget&#x27;s eyes glowed blue, and Cinder would sense something...else. Something vengeful.

It wouldn&#x27;t be easy, as they had never spoken about this to anyone. But something deep inside them really wanted to let it out and Gadget felt like a good hearted confidant. Cinder gratefully takes the drink **&quot;Thank you&quot;** They take a few sips and say **&quot;not what I&#x27;d usually drink, but I like it&quot;** A few sips later they look Gadget in the eyes and begin. **&quot;The first thing I want you to know is that you are the first person I&#x27;m telling this and I trust you to keep this between us. Let me start at the beginning. You and me are both infernal blooded, so we already have faint magical abilities by birth. While you enhanced your magical abilities by researching gems and other such magic, the power of the magic I was born with became stronger. I grew up in a town that was mainly comprised of humans, so I didn&#x27;t think any of my powers were more odd than I already was. And then the thing happened&quot;** Cinder takes a deep breath and a sip of their cocktail. **&quot;I was eight   years old at the time and was sitting at home in my room studying. And then suddenly I wasn&#x27;t. I remember seeing a frosty landscape with many mountains and glaciers. And I remember seeing this handsome devil. He told me that he was my father and that he&#x27;d bestowed a fragment of his power unto me. He told me that he could give me more, make me more powerful, if I did him a few favours in return. Foolish as I was at the time, I accepted his offer, binding myself to him. The next thing I remember was lying on the floor of my room, my chair tipped up and my tea spilt. Ever since, he has occasionally forced my mind to come and join him. Sometimes it knocks me out and sometimes I freeze up. But most times, I&#x27;ve been alone, when he&#x27;s done it&quot;** Cinder suddenly takes a big interest in their boots and shakes their head, not feeling up to meeting Gadget&#x27;s eye.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-07</p> <p class="message">**&quot;You got it boo!

When he was with her everything just seemed clearer, and she was able to focus so much better. The plasma caster should have taken her weeks to finish but with him there, painting his admittedly inferior battlemace troops who hadn&#x27;t been in the meta for nearly two years, things just felt easier. Even that was cut in its own way, both the fact he didn&#x27;t care for running a sub-optimal army AND manage to win with it! She was getting off track.

He even placed one of his wings around her shoulder while just sitting thre with her, calming her with his presence and his calm breaths. He gives it a long thought and actualy looked down at him and finaly notices the small streaks and dots of red in his feathers. They were miniscule but he had some good eyes.

Her smile fades a little and she suddenly feels conflicted, not wanting to say anything to ruin the moment or hurt him further. But...she should tell him, shouldn&#x27;t she? They had just gotten back together, no, maybe they were finally together for real this time! They were even telling each other how much they loved one another! She couldn&#x27;t jeopardize that could she!? She couldn&#x27;t take the risk of hurting him again right!? But if she started holding back now then what about next time something came up!? or the time after that!? What if she started lying to him about things thinking it was to protect him!?*

*What if!*

*WHAT IF!*

*Gadget&#x27;s breathing suddenly became quicker, with shorter breaths as she grabbed her chest. She almost seemed of breath but it wasn&#x27;t clear why.

It just felt so good to hear it from her and he was glad they had figured out their previous problrms. It was just so reasuring to be loved by her. If she hadn&#x27;t had taken him back he would probably have left the guild for good. Without her he probably couldn&#x27;t stand it here while she was still around.* **&quot;So Jerky then!&quot;** *He says, after a hug that lasted long and was as honest as it could be. He turned to the chest and pulled out a fresh pack of savory jerky and was looking forward for a snack himself. As he was turned, his tailfeathers brushed over Gadgets tail, softly tickling the extra appendage a bit as he flared and unflared them a bit.* **&quot;Also... I wanted to appologize for the bedsheets.&quot;** *He says after getting up and closing the chest.* **&quot;But yi am glad a didn&#x27;t scratched you up to much...&quot;** *He said, not knowing that Gadget had healed herself earlier.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Gadget smiled at his touch and closed her eyes, enjoying the feeling of his tongue against her ear. She was already learning things about how to please him, and he her in return. She giggled a bit, rather enjoying that she could still tease him, even if only a little. When he says she loves him...she can tell it was different from the night before. Different than when he said it in the throws of passion. It was like his words form the previous day. Words fueled by something pure and true. Love. Hearing him say it in that tone was better than sex. Sex was fun, no doubt, but that...was something more, and she could feel the same thing exploding inside of her.* **&quot;I love you too...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Arrius shuddered a little bit by her gesture. Just the fact that she was wearing a shirt made this little contact so much more exciting for him then it actualy should.

He leaned down and softly ran his beak over thexedge of her ear, letting his tounge flick out slightly to brush over it.* **&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot;** *He says in a tone that made it sound more like a joke then as a actusl question. He wouldn&#x27;t mind to throw himself into the sheets again but he would also appreciate it to just enjoy her a bit more just in his embrace but the hand that was softly brushing over her chest betrayed that thought greatly.* **&quot;I love how soft you are Gadget...&quot;** *He said with a warm voice.* **&quot;And... Because I haven&#x27;t said it enough... I love you.&quot;** *He says, pulling back his hand from under her shirt, brushing down her belly and over her thighs before leaving her soft skin alone.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*She mewed again, feeling his against her, leaning into him. She could sense a change in him, and she was happy he had found his confidence. She couldn&#x27;t take credit for it though; he had always had it. She had seen it in him during their battles against Albert and during their encounters around the guild. He just had to learn how to grab hold of it and make it his own...and he had. She, well, she had just been the thing that finally led him to realizing it. It was an honor really. Of course she also hadn&#x27;t minded it leading to them being together again, more than ever as a matter of fact.*

**&quot;Some of the jerky will be fine.

He realy appreciated the tone she had worked up and it made all this just the more sweet and rewarding. Before he just admired her for her bright nature and natural cuteness but now he had found something more he could admire. Even though her anatomy was alien to his and vice versa, he would be lying if she wasn&#x27;t beautiful and stirred in him feelings he never knew he had before and it brought out a side of him that was new to him as well. Confidence was suddendly part of him when he was with her, all the awkwardness, well not all of it but a god chunk, was fallen from his shoulders like a fresh molting of feathers. His eyes wandered over her form, and if he had lips he would bite one now when her tail slightly lifted her shirt to be a little bit revealing. He could feel his blood warming and his taileathers fsnning out to dissipate this new warmth building in him. He walks a little bit closer up to her, brushing up against her back, softly rubbing his talons around her waist, softly placing them on her slender and athletic belly.* **&quot;Hey...&quot;** *He replied softly, whispering into her ear.* **&quot;So... what do you crave for breakfast.&quot;** *He says, as he softly pushes his feathery chest against her back.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Gadget was floored not just by his words, but by the way he looked at her, making her giggle even more. He thought she was beautiful. HE SAID SHE AS BEAUTIFUL! She rolled around in bed just giggling into her pillow before suddenly popping up and taking a deep breath. She sat up and slipped her t-shirt on, part of her wanting to stay in the buff for her avian lover...and to show off, but she wasn&#x27;t quite ready for that yet. At least...not completely as her wagging tail occasionally swung up her shift to reveal the underside of her tone backside. Gadget did palates and wanted Arrius to know it, even if teasing him was a little redundant at this point.* **&quot;Hey~&quot;** *She whispered as she walked over next time him, making sure her body grazed his more often than not, getting out a large beaker, burner, and coffee can.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Arrius poofed up a bit more as she mentioned how they got to wake up in her bed in the first place and followed up with her giggling as he burried his face in her neck. It was all so sureal but he loved any second of it.* **&quot;I can&#x27;t even remember most of it... It was all such a blurr... But a realy good blurr.&quot;** *He says, rubbing his beak at her neck before he slowly let go of Gadget. He just noticed what a mess her bed had become. There where talonmarks on the frame, the sheets were torn and feathers everywhere. As Arrius got onto his knees he just sat there above her and looked down at his partner in all her glory. His big bird eyes looked softly down at her as he smiled.* **&quot;You&#x27;re realy beatiful like this Gadget.&quot;** *He says, admiring her soft curves, the slight gone of her muscles. He just sit there for a moment of admiration before he slowly crawled of the bed before stumbling to his feat way less gracefull then planned. His legs felt like pudding as he made his way over to the bench in his uncovered, feathery glory.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Gadget laid on her back looking up toward him with her hands resting on her chest, blushing  heavily. This was all new to her and she was still figuring out how to react to all of it. Her tail swiping back and forth slowly was probably a good sign that she was really enjoying it though. Feeling his beak through her hair she let out a little mewing before finally managing to answer.* **&quot;I keep some snacks in a box...under the bench where we...started yesterday.&quot;** *She turned red as a beet and covered her face with her hands, giggling as everything started to set in. She had gone and let herself be swept off her feet by a hansom heroic man! OH MY GAWD!!!*

*When he did go looking, Arrius wouldn&#x27;t find a small box but a small crate filled with so much junk food. Sweets, jerky, freeze dried noodles, and a lot of other similar long lasting and extremely tasty but not necessarily super healthy foods. How did she stay in such good shape eating stuff like this? She lay in the bed still glowing in her own way with she reached down to find a piece of clothing to put on, eventually dragging a big, baggy T-shirt under the blankets and slowly putting it on.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*The Aarakocra closes his eyes in a smile as he leans his beak against her forehead softly. He didn&#x27;t want to move right now but he wouldn&#x27;t mind, stretching his limbs and back a bit given that he tried to be as encompasing a spossible for Gadget, to cover as much of her soft skin in his feathery embrace as he could. A very soft but happy sigh escapes him as he softly shuffles about, slowly, reluctently, pulling hisxwing from beneath her beautiful and slightly toned body. A short swaff of cold air hit Gadget as he pulled back his wings but it was quickly replaced by the warmth and softness of her matress as Arrius slowly turns the two of them over as he rolls on top of her.* **&quot;Do you have something here that I should get you?&quot;** *He asks softly, having his weight softly resting on her, not that he was particularly heavy.* **&quot;I don&#x27;t feel like going into the hall right now.&quot;** *He says, his beak brushing through her hair.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Gadget wanted to get lost in that warmth, to swim in it if she could. It was like sunshine but...nicer. Softer. She felt like she could just lay there forever in his arms, under his wings, not even realizing at that moment that her own infernal blood wasn&#x27;t bowling. Wasn&#x27;t telling her to fight or run or anything like that. It was so weird...it never reacted to things it should but rather to her anger...or to other kinds of evil. She wasn&#x27;t thinking about any of that though, not while she had this huge feathered hunk in her arms as he gently caressed her. But alas her stomach demanded sustenance with another loud growl and she turned her face up reluctantly, though her cheek was still pressed against him as she spoke with a cute but mournful tone.* **&quot;I guess...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*A very soft, gentle chuckle rolled out of Arrius throat as he softly brushed his feathered wing over her back, sending little tingles from the subtle movement down her spine.* **&quot;Hungry?&quot;** *He asks very very softly, nearly a whisper as if he was trying to not disturb their soft embrace further. His chest poofed a bit more as a soft glow started to come from it as Gadget could feel, for the first time the warmth and cause of Arrius divine soul brushing over her. He had often glowed when fhey were together but not in such an intimate embrace like now. And it wasn&#x27;t discriminating her for her infernal heritage even though it came from the higher planes. The warmth and glow comes just from his feelings for her, for the love he felt for the blue woman that was completely enveloped by her feathered lover.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Gadget listened to the sound of Arrius&#x27; heart and get lost in it, in more ways than one. After a few minutes of just laying there in their combined warmth though, another sound radiated from Gadget. A low, feral growl that echoed from her stomach for all to hear. She grumbled defiantly and sank her face deeper into Arrius&#x27; plumage, speaking a groggy and muffled voice.* **&quot;Shut up stomach, I&#x27;m busy...&quot;** *She sank her face as deep as she could to try and ignore the sound even as it became louder, her grip on her avian companion gripping in defiance of life trying to pull them apart.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Arrius lay still when Gadget left his embrace, he was sound asleep in the warmth and exhaustion of their reunion. Never had it cross his mind that he would find love in this guild, or find it at all in that matter but here he is. Exhausted, happy and finaly back together with the woman that was the first to reach his lonely heart. As Gadget slipped back into his embrace, her face resting against his floofy chest, she could hear Arrius&#x27;s strong heart pumping in his chest, beating strongly in a steady rythm. It was a comforting sound, the **thump thump thump** of what gave him life. His talons slowly and instinctively wrapped around her blue and soft form, the soft feathers of his wings gently brushing over the soft skin of her nacked form as they returned to embrace her. The two awkward and unlikely lovers just lay there, in a warm and safe embrace.
Even when Arrius rose, there wasn&#x27;t much movement for him unlike the first time Gadget had snuggled up to him during their first quest together. He didn&#x27;t say anything, he just lay ther with her, his grip getting just a light bit tighter and his beak, softly caressing one of her horns.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Gadget stirs from slumber, feeling something warm and soft against her. She just lays there for a moment until finally memories start flooding back to her mind and she looks over her shoulder to see Arrius behind her, his wings draped around her protectively. She smiles and snuggles against him only to feel a slight tinge of pain. She looks at herself as sees several scratches and minor puncture wounds. Nothing serious, but clear signs that she had lost her concentration at some point during the through of passion. She looked back at him, his face sweet as he breathed against her and she couldn&#x27;t help but smile. She slowly lifted herself from bed, trying desperately not to wake him, and slowly walked over to one of her work tables. Her room was a mess, not that it wasn&#x27;t always, but she found the yellow gem she was looking for relatively easily. Focusing her magic through it she could feel the wounds healing, not even realizing the numerous scratches across her back that were there. But the closed shut, as if they had never happened, and she let out a small sigh. She thought about taking a shower and finding something to eat amongst her various &quot;emergency rations&quot; but looked back at Arrius with drowsy eyes. She walked over, slipped back into bed facing him, and pulled a cover over them both, pulling close to him and rubbing her face into his chest. He was warm...and she wanted to be close to that warmth for just a little longer...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-27</p> <p class="message">Fade to Black Alternative: Probably more innocent than it seems.

It certainly would be weird, awkward and probably realy funny but in the end, they were together and that was what was important.

She thought for a moment but then came to a realization. She wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work or but she touched the choker around her neck as a thin layer of feathers and tougher skin covered her body. Not enough to make her look like a bird, but enough to hopefully keep her safe while they...made out?

A minute passed by with nothing but silence, until finally the door opened and there stood Gadget, dressed in a baggy t-shirt and tights, her hair a mess and heavy bags under her eyes from lack of sleep and occasional crying. But more than that was something that glimmered around her neck. It was an odd looking choker that looked like a feather of mixed gold and silver with a blue stone set in its center. Gadget looked toward Arrius, seeing him proofed up but grey and nearly started crying. With tears in the corners of her eyes and a sniff she reached up and touched the choker, a glimmer of magic causing her hair to turn pink for a second before turning back to normal.

**&quot;Geez, no wonder my mom said the physical infusion was dangerous. If you don&#x27;t get the resonance just right it could do some real damage to you. Still, it should be fine now.&quot;** *She reached up and touched the gem stone, a bit of magic entering into it. The light within the gem strengthened and suddenly her body began to change. Within seconds she had gone from a normal blue tiefling into basically the dragonborn equivalent of herself! Blue scales, snout, the works!*

**&quot;IT WORKS! IT ACTUALLY WORKS! I...I...oh wow, I&#x27;m jacked!&quot;** *Gadget gave her new form a once over and was surprised by how tall and broad she was. Were all dragonborn this well...built?*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*Arrius gulps and starts. He couldn&#x27;t loose Gadget here! She was the first person to make him feel like he mattered and made him feel like he belonged somewhere! That was such a weird feeling!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*She smiles as the gem glows again, the veins pulsating and her cringing in pain.* **&quot;You better get started...&quot;** *The process is easy enough in theory, and in execution it isn&#x27;t terrible, each ping of the tiny hammer causing the gem to glow and change into various mixed colors.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*Arrius leans forward and leans his head against hers.* **&quot;I...

His hand Eye coordination wasn&#x27;t so bad but right now, under this much pressure? He didn&#x27;t wanted to do anything wrong and feeling her pulse being so erratic was more then conscerning. &quot;I don&#x27;t like quicktime events&quot; he thought, no Idea why but what else could he do.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">**&quot;You silly bird...*huff*...you&#x27;re really cute when you&#x27;re anxious.&quot;** *She fiddled with the hammers, looking at one but then switching to another. She pulled it off the ring and wearily put it into Arrius left hand before reaching for his right. She felt so weak as she did, but managed to bring it up to her neck. She pressed his fingers against her skin as best she could, before letting her arm drop.* **&quot;Feel my pulse? I need you to hit the gem in synch with it. Not too hard. Just gently *huff* as you can...until I tell you to stop.&quot;** *On the surface it seemed like a simple request except as he felt her pulse it was fluctuating pretty erratically, racing at some points while slowing to a crawl at others. Arrius had a rhythm game on his hands.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*Arrius slowly gets up, trying to keep an Eye on Gadget. This, this was so strange! What did she do. Arrius stumbled his way over to the table and picked up the keyring with the tiny hammers and trys to walk back to her and not to trip. He was trying his best but he slipped on a cylinder and falls face first in front of Gadger. Sure it hurts but he was always someone who helped others in need and Gadget needed him right now. Not to mention that he liked her a lot! He reached out to give her the tiny hammers as a box of screws started to tip and empty it&#x27;s contents onto his head wich made him squak in suprise before he rolled out of the way.* **&quot;SORRY!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Just stay calm. We can fix th-&quot;** *Suddenly the gem glowed and the veins around it seemed to grow, Gadget tensing as they did.* **&quot;Okay...we&#x27;re good. I&#x27;m good. I&#x27;m not good. On the station behind you there are some comically tiny hammers with runes on the flats all on a key ring. Bring them over here.&quot;** *She points to the table in question and while it is a cluttered mess the little hammers stand out. They look like mice barbarians would use them for mauls honestly.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*Arrius blinks at her once, then twice and then would have fainted but instead.* **&quot;Wh... How? What did you do Gadget?&quot;** *He asked her confused, his expression just utter confusion. It wasn&#x27;t as bad as he had thought but not much better either.* **&quot;What do I do?&quot;** *He asks, trying to stay calm but the rustleing of his feathers was audible.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Of...*huff* ...course I am. I just need you to help me fix this...&quot;** *Gadget turned over, her back now against the workstation, revealing something that was more than odd. In the center of her chest was a oval shaped gem which somehow looked fused to her skin, several vein or root like extension spreading from it across her chest and toward her right shoulder. But the real shock was her right arm, shoulder, and face, which were all covered in blue scales. Her nails were black and slightly pointed, a few of her teeth sharper than usual, and her eye clearly more draconic looking. She was breathing heavily as she tried to laugh a bit.* **&quot;I clearly got the resonance wrong...I just need you to grab a few tools for me and *huff* and help me fix it. Easy *huff* peasy...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*Arrius was already panicing but the look of worry was masking that pretty good.* **&quot;Wh...What happened Gadget?&quot;** *He askesd. She didn&#x27;t looked to good he had to admit. Did she overwork herself?* **&quot;Are... Are you alright?&quot;** *He asks, getting on one knee to be closer to her.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*The room is, indeed, pretty chaotic, various projects setting around in a half completed state, but no immediate sign of Gadget herself.* **&quot;Over here...&quot;** *Gadget said this with a strange sound in her voice, as if it was slightly distorted somehow. Following it though would lead Arrius to behind of the workbenches where he would find Gadget clad in baggy pants and a tube top sitting with her back slightly turned to Arrius. She peaked over and gave a weak looking smile, something clearly wrong as she concealed her arm.* **&quot;Now, remember...you said you wouldn&#x27;t panic...right?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">*Arrius got a pretty worried look on his face.* **&quot;Y-You know how wuickly I panic Gadget... But I do my best!&quot;** *He says gulping, his feathers a bit shaking. What had Gadget done now? He had no Idea what she could do... What if she replaced her nose with an weird apparatus or she lost a limb building something! Spurned by worry Arrius bursts into the room, looking around the Chaos for Gadget.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-22</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Arrius!?&quot;** *, Gadget yelled form within her room.* **&quot;Is that you!?

In her arms was Sir Flops Alot, her stuffed rabbit, who she carried by its arm like she used to as a kid. Used to...no...she was still a kid. At least that was how she felt as she fell into her bed, rolling up into a ball and squeezing the stuffed toy tightly. She knew Maretta didn&#x27;t mean anything but what she had said, and knew her using fire didn&#x27;t have anything to do with her being a tiefling. Right? She felt her chest tighten a bit, fear creeping into her mind.*

{FIEND}

*She heard the word echo through her mind, her breathing picking up.*

{MONSTER}

*She squeezed Sir Hops Alot tighter, biting her lips almost to the point of drawing blood.*

{DEVIL}

*She was crying now, hyperventilating, and trying not to scream out from the stress.*

~Angel~

*She heard her mother&#x27;s voice and thought it was in her head, until she heard it again. Looking around she looked down at Flops Alot and saw the little gemstone connect to its collar. She rubbed the tone only for it to produce her mother&#x27;s voice again. It was a simple infusion, nothing crazy or difficult, but that didn&#x27;t matter. In that moment though it was the most valuable jewel in the world.*

**&quot;Mom...thank you...&quot;**

*She looked over and saw the package her mother had sent her, standing up to grab on of the note books. She started reading, her mom&#x27;s sass still bleeding through even in the technical jargon and causing her to laugh on occasion. Soon she was eating the cookies too as she started thinking of ways to use the new knowledge and assets her mother had sent her. She then pulled the blue gem Maretta had given her out of her pocket and looked it over. She knew exactly what she was going to do with it...it was gong to be loud.* 

**&quot;Alright Flops, let&#x27;s get to work.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-20</p> <p class="message">---------------------</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-16</p> <p class="message">*Arrius was panicing inside but he softly took her hand, minding his talons not to scratch her with them.* **&quot;Th...

She then emerged with a blanket held tightly to her chest, looking down at the ground and a nervous smile on her face.* **&quot;S-So...uh...ready to go?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-16</p> <p class="message">*Arrius nodded again quickly and overeager.* **&quot;I... uhm..

Maybe...maybe do some stargazing?&quot;** *She said this blushing so heavily even her shoulders were turning red.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-16</p> <p class="message">**&quot;For... for liking... what... this...&quot;** *He points at the tabbard and glows a bit more.* **&quot;It just lay on my bed... this morning... with the other things...&quot;** *He said uncomfortably.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-16</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Bwuh!?

He had no Idea what to do, what to say or what to do? He had traded his normal attire and his leather Armor for a white and blue tabbard and a simple T-shirt like shirt with long bands flowing down it&#x27;s sleeves down to his waist. His plumage was groomed but poofed up like crazy at the moment as this was his version of blushing, and of course, he was glowing as usual.* **&quot;H..HEY!&quot;** *He squaked a bit, scratching the back of his head, trying not to stare at Gadget.* **&quot;YOU...

He liked her for her! Wait did he like her!? OF COURSE HE DID! He wouldn&#x27;t have asked her out if he didn&#x27;t!!! Would he? WOULD HE!?* **&quot;I&#x27;M NOT HYPERVENTILATING! HONESTLY!&quot;** *She was. She just was. Finally she found herself in a pretty simple sundress with a choker bearing a single sapphire in its center and some ankle strap flats. She felt...something. Her heart fluttered a little and she took a breath. OH! She ran over to a drawer and dug through it, putting on an silver bracelet lined with bit of lapis. She then used her magical tinkers into infuse her choker and bracelet with the smell of lilac. Now everything was perfect! Weren&#x27;t they? WEREN&#x27;T THEY!? She opened the door and looked shyly toward the floor, only glancing up after a second to look upon Arrius.* **&quot;Uh....hey.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-16</p> <p class="message">*Also the feather a certain Bird gifted her starts to glow faintly again.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-05-16</p> <p class="message">*There is a knock at Gadgets door.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-11</p> <p class="message">*The room was...cluttered. Okay maybe that was an understatement, but there was definitely a bed somewhere around there so it still qualified as a room. One pile of assorted tools, crystals, and incomplete gizmos suddenly shifted as Gadget rose up out of it, still in her baggy shirt and shorts with a pair of goggles on her head. She had actually got into her night clothes to get some proper sleep, but then she had an idea...which lead to another idea...and another. Before long she had pretty much buried herself and drifted off mid something or other. She scratched her head and crawled off to her closet, entering it and closing the door behind her. Several clanks, crashes, and...a tambourine? When had she gotten that? Gadget exited the closet in a halter top and  capris. She walked over, the floof of her tail sweeping the ground a bit as she went. Okay, maybe she should clean her room properly but, well, FOOD FIRST! She slipped on some flat sandals and headed out of her room, running back in to grab a feather from a drawer near her night stand. She still hadn&#x27;t figured out what sort of trinket to make out of it, but for now she just had a little loop attached to it and stuck it behind her ear like a pen, wrapping the loop around the lobe to keep it in place. She muffled a girlish giggle before running out again, closing the door behind her.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-11</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/709095950999748668/709197318410469387/WnW_Room_Options_15.jpg"/></li>
