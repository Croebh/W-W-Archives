Distant commotions, a bad feeling in the back of his head... then a meteor hit the guild?! Vian stopped his meditation, gathered his swords, and took to the hallway, long strides giving away his displeasure at the disturbances. Some meteor was going to get its ass kicked.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-06-17</p> <p class="message"></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-06-17</p> <p class="message">Once again, in his chambers. The door was sealed behind him as he reflected upon his conversation with Storm. over to the low table he went, kneeling before it as he often did, right on the wood floor. The book was set down, and Vian looked over it, considered the illumination, the title, the binding. He felt tired. Truly, reading this book seemed like a wise idea, didn&#x27;t it? Seeing the grim look across the tabaxi&#x27;s eyes... Hmm. Vian knew what that look was. It was disturbing to see it on the honorable Storm. How would it feel to see it in Kessans eyes? Marettas? Kjara&#x27;s? 

Vian closed hsi eyes and tried to meditate. The warm breeze comign through the window enhanced his distracted nature, how riled up and irritated he was over this. It shouldn&#x27;t bother him. He was put on this world to grow strong, return home, and blood was the consequence. It was always going to be. This was no surprise or mystery to him.

He stood up, moving to the huge sword hanging on his wall. A trophy from a flain fire giant. Fingers slid along its cutting edge. ||&quot;**Will I be a giant, a marauder, to be cut down and made trophies of?&quot;**||  He squeezed his lightly cut fingertips, sealing the wounds with the skills, the magic he had unlocked here... *So trivial now, but a year ago I would have thought this witchcraft.*  

After a bit of rummaging, Vian finds an old gift. A flute, simple, hand carved from wood, given to him by an old friend. So long unused it was dusty when he first blew into it. While unrefined, perhaps even unskilled...Through the solitary desertborns window, soft flute notes began to drift on the wind.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-06-09</p> <p class="message">After the oddity of earlier, Vian returns to his room. Bandages, a change of clothes, and a cup of tea were prepared. Strange poeple in this guild, up down left and right... He sipped at his tea, sitting in his room in light undergarments, and began to read through the lyrics aghayon had given him. Hmm. Hum. Strange. He found himself wondering if Aghayon actually understood the lyrics or not! EIther way, it would be a peaceful evening for the desertborn...</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-05-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Indeed.

I&#x27;ll see you later then.&quot;** *Aghayon says with a nod before turning towards the door.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-04-29</p> <p class="message">Vian raises an eyebrow slowly, remembering that bathing suit.

But keep that between us for now. Since nothings set in stone yet and I don&#x27;t want to ruin the suprise for everyone!&quot;** *Mostly he didn&#x27;t want Kjara to know because Aghayon was sure that her seeing Vian sing this song would realy push on her tearduckts and pull on the heartstrings!* **&quot;I come over after dinner tonight if thats ok and we can start practicing. How does that sound?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-04-26</p> <p class="message">Practice singing?

Singing is just melodic talking and even though I know you don&#x27;t like talking so much, your Voice was made for this!&quot;** *He says with a smile as Vian takes the song lyrics of Baka Mitai into his hands.* **&quot;Also we have time until then. So we can practice together singing it. I am still trying to get the music down as well because the song, despite having a guitar part in it, is hard to follow with just that instrument.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-04-20</p> <p class="message">Vian sheaths his sword, slowly standing up to take the paper from Aghayon. He raised his eyebrow, reading it over slowly. **&quot;I am not particularly well suited to this task, I warn you.&quot;** Truth told, Vian did not have much singing experience.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-04-19</p> <p class="message">*Aghayon scratches the back of his head and chuckles a bit awkwardly.* **&quot;You got me right there Vian.&quot;** *He says before reaching into his jacket and pulls out a neatly folded pack of papers.* **&quot;I was thinking... Currently most members are out to missions and I wonderd if we should organize a little event for everyone once they are back. Sure I need to talk with Maretta first buuut... I doubt that shouod be a problem.&quot;** *He says and holds the paper out to Vian.* **&quot;I am a freetime musician and I think you would have a great voice for this particular song and I would be veryy appreciative of you singing it at the event in a duette. Little bonus, the Song is written in Celestial so it might be a little easier for you to get into it.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-04-19</p> <p class="message">Vian watched the other dragonborn for a few moments, trying to discern his intention. He never looked amused, but he certainly looked extra unamused at the moment!  **&quot;A craft left to those whom have practiced it.&quot;** His stare got considerably more critical. **&quot;I suspect you are not curious about my opinion alone, though.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-04-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;What are your thoughts on singing Vian?&quot;** *Aghayon asks, holding his hands in front of his own face with the palms held together.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2021-04-18</p> <p class="message">Vian was impressed that the other could speak his language, more or less.

I heard of that!&quot;** *He says with a smike as he got a look at the blade before his gaze got pulled towards the massive fire giant sword in the corner.* **&quot;Must have been quite a fight against that giant...

The room was simple, elegant, with hand painted scrolls in his language, paintings, and an exceptionally oversiwed sword horizontally hung along one wall. Airy and bright with sunlight, just as he liked it. He did not stop his task after a brief pause, continuing his maintenance cycle on his flametongue. **&quot;No interruption, Honorable Aghayon.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-04-17</p> <p class="message">*The door opens and walking in was a crtain handsome tall black scaled dragonborn with two swords on his hips and wearing what seemed like a very comfortable looking three piece suit out f white fabric and a red shirt.* **&quot;Hello Vian! I hope I am not interrupting anything.&quot;** *Aghayon said with a friendly smile on his lips as his white eyes took in the room.* **&quot;You have a nice room!

You wanted something in return for the fact that you lend me your sandbox to practice.&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-27</p> <p class="message">He nodded again, swirling his brush in the excess water to clean the ink out of it. But then her last question. [draconic] ||**&quot;The... prize?&quot;**|| He stopped and looked at her. How to interpret that? He was confused, clearly: his upbringing, the skill and the opportunity was the reason to learn, no more, no less.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-27</p> <p class="message">*Kjara just stood there and watched him, her tail slowly swinging behind her in a very relaxed manner.* [Draconic] || **&quot;Are you sure about that?&quot;**|| *She asks in a slightly excited tone. She could use the practice and making paint like he does looked like it would go onto her Arms pretty quickly.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind the chance to practice... but... I don&#x27;t know if I would have the diciplin to do it all by myself... Also...&quot;**|| *She lets out a chuckle.* ||**&quot;Whats the prize?&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-27</p> <p class="message">He nodded simply to her, working on his painting in simple, thought out srokes. Simple, just black on the beige of the parchment. It was not a glorious painting, but it was reasonably nice. [Draconic]||**&quot;a good mindset. If you like, you may take the sand box to practice. &quot;**|| He raised an eyebrow with a snall bit of warmth in his expression. ||**&quot;Your room id next to mine, after all.&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-24</p> <p class="message">*Kjara ponders over her picture, puts a little stroke here and there but... It felt off. As she heared the sloshing of water she got distracted and looked over to see what Vian was doing. Seeing him mixing paint was... Weird to say the least but also a bit reassuring. There was so much more to him then the foreign dragonborn that kicked the shit out of her and the man who never had brownies before. He was an enigma she loved to understand more. She listens to his words  and nods understanding before stepping behind him with some distance to just simply watch him paint.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;I&#x27;d rather improve myself indefinetly then try and master anything Vian... Being a master of something sounds actualy pretty boring if you ask me. Where is the fun in something you like but can&#x27;t improve further upon?&quot;**|| *The female dragonborn asks while watching him paint.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-24</p> <p class="message">[Draconic] ||**&quot;Yes, that is at the core of this exercise, and painting. And swordsmanship.&quot;**|| Vian moved to his supplies, gathering them as he spoke, pouring some of the powders and mixing them with water rather tediously. Such was the nature of his paints. Soon he took one of the odd brushes, thick and long, but with a very tapered tip, and spread out some paper from a roll of parchment, and began to paint as he spoke, his face stony yet relaxed. [draconic] ||**&quot;Do not seek anything but to improve the skill. You should not seek to make a masterpiece, as once you have mastered a skill, there is no more room to grow. The sword is much the same.&quot;**|| He painted surprisingly fast, sweeps of the brush, using it&#x27;s weight to imply shadows, thin lines for lit areas. A simple mountainscape, trees... It was certainly not as nice as some of his others, but he continued regardless, seemingly satisfied.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-23</p> <p class="message">[Draconic] ||**&quot;Then you were a good listener!&quot;**|| *She says with a chuckle and then clears out her picture after looking at it once again. Maybe she tries something with water this time! Something with flowing lines wich totaly went against how she would strike with her weapon but how she got out of an attack. She pondered that and made some of the wide arking motions she would make after a strike.* [Draconic.] ||**&quot;Hmm... Do you ever have the feeling that what you do is less efficient then it could be?&quot;**|| *Kjara ask as she looks brooding at the chicken stratches she managed to do so far. She didn&#x27;t know why but it felt off.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-23</p> <p class="message">Her expression went over his head with the extra explanation. He tried to wrap his head around it, but the words just kept coming, and... Well, he simply nodded once to let her have a moment of confidence out of it. Surely, it made sense to people who lived here! But then she called him wise. He thought about it for a moment, then shook his head. [draconic] ||**&quot;No... I simply had wise teachers. One day I will be wise. Now, why don&#x27;t you do a few more attempts? Perhaps I will prepare my own tools and join you.&quot;**|| For a moment, he wished there was more sounds of nature here. His room barely caught the sound of the wind, it seemed like, but nothing compared to the whistle of desert wind.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-22</p> <p class="message">*Kjara tilts her head a little before her face lights up as if she had a enlightening moment.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;Reminds me of another saying we have here... The way is the goal... Or at least I think thats what it was... It means that not the goal of a journey is the defining point of said journey but the way that got you to where you want to be... does that sound right?&quot;**|| *She asks him if she made a good analogy. She wondered, was she proud of the way she took to this point in time? Did she feel joy about her decisions she had taken in live? She looks at Vian and his warm expression and... felt good... A warm smile crept on her face and seemed flustered all of the sudden.* [Draconic] ||*&quot;You are pretty wise Vian... And... thank you...&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-22</p> <p class="message">He offered her a curt nod, his face warming a little without smiling. [draconic] ||**&quot;Yes, it is a difficult thing to explain. There are technical aspects, things to do right and wrong... But you are off to a strong start. The sand also teaches you another important thing: Even though you are creating, these creations are transitory. Your pride and joy should be in the creating, not the product. Does... that make sense?&quot;**|| And the sand was not wasteful. That was certainly important.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-22</p> <p class="message">*The female Dragonborn beams at him happily! He realy thought she had some talent into this? Vian had probably no Idea how happy that made her actualy.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;You realy think so? I am not sure if I should go for paint already...&quot;**|| *She says but stil smiles at him before she looks at her sand picture again. Kjara was not sure if she liked what she painted but for now it would do. There was no perfection on the first try and perfection was not what she sought anyway.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;But I get what you ment when you said it has something akin to meditation... While painting... I felt relaxed even though I was realy trying to do good... And... What you said about translating technique into strokes... It felt natural... It is hard to discribe realy.&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-21</p> <p class="message">He watched as she brushed the sand, the desert dragonborn taking in her form, her methods, how she held the brush. Honestly, he was impressed. She clearly had more skill than she let on, or a natural inclination towards this. [draconic] ||**&quot;Hmm. You may not need such simple practice. Perhaps you should graduate to inks and paint, if this is any indication.&quot;**|| To be fair, he knew he was no teacher, too, but she seemed like she had a strong start. [draconic] ||**&quot;You hold the brush correctly, for the most part, you are confident and delicate at once. It shows that you learned something about calligraphy once. You will make a fine painter with practice.&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-20</p> <p class="message">*Kjara was still excited over all of this so her tail was lifting her shirt just enough to reveal the form fitting hotpants she was wearing. Kjara carefully took the drawing stick and took a deep breath to calm herself down a bit. She looked around before she puts the drawing pen onto the sand. Her strokes were... bold and quick but also precise. A mimic of her fencing technique. She realy took his words to heart, trying to translate her technique into art. She didn&#x27;t try to copy any of Vians pictures but rather let herself be inspired by them.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;Am I doing this right?&quot;**|| *The female dragonborn asks, stepping away from the picture a little, nearly bumping into him because she was suprisingly focused as she looked at the beginning of a sunset over some hills. There were a lot of obvious mistakes but there was potential.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-20</p> <p class="message">[Draconic]||**&quot;Ah, yes... Revealing.&quot;**|| He looked at her for a moment. The tail was still strange to him, and his eyes gave it a moments look. Nothing else, of course. Of course! [draconic] ||**&quot;It, uh. You should always be... comfortable... when.. painting? But.. but yes, yes, the sand is a teaching tool. To be gentle, to get a steady hand and confidence. I imagine your ability to handle your needleblade will translate well to a paint brush, Kjara.&quot;**|| Further shoving distractions aside, he offered her the drawing stick, a mimicry of a paintbrush, and gestured to the paintings on the walls. [draconic] ||**&quot;Be not afraid. No one is born with skills, and only a coward mocks a beginner. Try to match one of my paintings, mimic them. The sand will teach you to use your pressure carefully. Perhaps once you start to learn, we will take the tool to real life. My paintings are no substitute for true nature.&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-20</p> <p class="message">*Kjara walks over as he gathered his supplies and listens to his words. He had used a language she didn&#x27;t recognised that was true and she wonderedwhat language that was. As Vian gathered his supplies she walks closer and looks confused at the sand.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;That sounds... Actualy pretty interesting... And true... There is rarely something you can use a weapon for that isn&#x27;t killing someone... Though we have some performers in these lands who use their weapons to perform plays... But learning art to balance out the blade... Sounds actualy pretty nice.&quot;**|| *She says and watches him in awe how he painted a beautiful scene into the sand. She doubted that she could draw like this even though he mad it look very easy. She wasn&#x27;t sure if she should try it already but it looked so interesting! Aso she felt dumb now about her clothes.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;Wow Vian! That  looked amazing!&quot;**|| *She says with awe and wonder not only in her voice but also in her eyes.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;And yes! I would love to try! I doubt I will do anything good looking but... If I am not willing to try then what am I doing here right?&quot;**|| *The Dragonborn asks him as she comes pretty close to him without actualy making contact..* [Draconic] ||**&quot;And If I had known we don&#x27;t use paint yet I wouldn&#x27;t have put on this revealing clothes...&quot;**||</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Falsemind#2181</p><p class="time">2020-06-20</p> <p class="message">[draconic] ||**&quot;Very few in these lands recognize my home language. It bears resemblance to one in these lands, but it very different. And yes, I did make these. It is a meditative effort, to make art. Very good for the soul.&quot;**|| He moved to gather his supplies, pulling out a strange dish of sorts. A bag of very fine sand was poured into the large, shallow square, and the whole thing tapped to become even and smooth. [draconic] ||**&quot;A blade is a weapon. It becomes an extension of you, and serves to do little more than end life, destroy, even in the most ideal situation. Therefor, our philosophy in my homeland... A warrior should learn to create, to let a brush become an extension of them just as well, to keep the energy of the soul balanced and in harmony.&quot;**|| He pulled out a wooden stick, smooth and clean, and demonstrated the practice sand by carefully drawing some mountains in the sand, gentle flicks of his &#x27;brush&#x27; to create clouds, delicate patterns turning into gentle hills and grasses. [draconic]||**&quot;We will practice with this tool. Simple and effective, and not wasteful. Would you like to try?&quot;**|| He tapped it out smooth, instantly destroying the pretty scene he had &#x27;painted.&#x27;</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-06-19</p> <p class="message">*Kjara follows him in and looks around. She liked the minimalistic look even though it was the polar opposite to her room. Maybe she should tone it down a bit as well. You didn&#x27;t need a lot of pomp and glamour if you are living alone afterall. She carefully walked around and looked at the pictures and the criptures he had in his room.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;It is impressive nonetheless Vian! Did you make those pictures?&quot;**|| *She asks a rather obvious question but her voice was certainly in a tone of interest. She hadn&#x27;t seen anything like this before so she was intrigued to say the least. She leaned forward a bit and her tail raised slightly, showing her excitement as it swung back and forth a little.*[Draconic] ||**&quot;I&#x27;ve learned calligraphy when I was a child but... I doubt calligraphy here and in your home have a lot in common besides to produce good looking writing.

He had barely decorated, the space looking clean and spartan. A handful of mementos sat on the desk, along with a lovely looking teapot and two cups, brought form home. For a noble man, he had very simple tastes it seemed. Notably, the only things really decorating the space were paintings and calligraphy: His own work, one could guess, the bold writing of his homeland in a beautiful, rich black and red inking. Long scrolls of it hung on the walls, along with a few paintings of similar nature, using thin, watery paints to achieve inky, watercolor like looks. [draconic] ||**&quot;Painting in my homeland is different than here. The thick paints of this land are appealing, but not my preference. No, where I am from, it is more like calligraphy, another skill a good warrior should practice in my opinion.&quot;**||</p></li>
