She had many things to look forward to... Perhaps she will make good use of the opportunities presented here yet.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#3b9da5">Dusk Argentum#6530</p><p class="time">2021-02-22</p> <p class="message">Dew smiled as she read the letter. Perhaps power is not the only takeaway she had gained from her most recent quest. She had gained some allies, as well. She began to think of what she could teach Jhin... Her specialty was water-based magic, but most druids likely prefer a blend of other magics as well.

She pulled out a piece of parchment from her desk, and began writing.

<blockquote>
Jhin,

Thank you for reaching out to me. You likely had no way of knowing this, but your letter had come at an opportune time. I had been wondering about my effectiveness as a healer ever since our return, but your words of encouragement and your request for tutelage have helped to abate that negativity for now.

Your familiar is amazing, by the way. A falcon of lotus petals is truly a feat to behold (though, if I may mention, completely obvious as a magical creature...). Their beauty is truly unmatched, though. May they serve you well.

I would be happy to help you understand the fundamentals of druidic magic, though I must admit my skillset may be considered &quot;lacking&quot; by most druid&#x27;s terms (as you may have noted, I stick mostly to water-based spells). You choose the time and place.

Dew

It would knock again.. then a few more times.. and when she&#x27;d look at what the source of the sound was, she&#x27;d find the silhouette of a falcon of sorts. Coming closer though, it wasn&#x27;t any normal falcon. Where one would expect to see feathers on a bird, light illuminated petals of a lotus flower instead. The lotus falcon pecks at her window once more, as if beckoning for Dew to open it.. and then it plucks something connected to its leg. It was an envelope.*

*The falcon would look up to Dew.. golden beady eyes swirling with magic. A hint of scarlet would swirl within them, and once Dew picked the envelope up, the lotus falcon would turn and fly away.. leaving a twirling spiral of lotus petals in its path.*

*The envelope was small, and the letter within was short. The penmanship was exquisite though.. likely done by someone who held great attention to detail as an artist would. It read:*

<blockquote>
Thank you for proving my initial thoughts about you incorrect. You were an important part of the team of our latest mission together, and for that, you have my sincerest respect. If you don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;d like to take up a lesson or two on from you about the magics derived from nature itself that you seem to utilise to great means. I may not use it personally, but knowledge is power, and I wish to be able to teach Wonder in that regard if they prefer that as their medium of magic in the future.

Artistically,
Khada Jhin.

PS: Familiars are an extremely versatile asset. Seeing yours and Ashok&#x27;s told me as much, and I must say I find mine quite useful already. Wonder thinks they&#x27;re cute too.. though mine could use a name still.

Her powers have certainly grown since she&#x27;s departed, however. When she left, she could not summon waves and walls of water, and she could not deprive a creature of its water, nor control it in the way she can now. She was not sure what this amounted to quite yet.

She thumbs her Ring. Another item gained since leaving her home. She has not used it much, but she has grand plans for it.

She gets up from her bed, and walks over to her desk. She pulls out one of her recently-acquired diamonds and sets it upon the desk, and waves her ring-bearing hand over it. The diamond evaporates, and now, within her ring, is a Revivification. She will not lose any of those here who she cares for. She also channels a slightly powered-up Cure Wounds into it.

**&quot;||In case of emergencies.||&quot;** [Druidic]

She resolves to grow stronger, and to be able to help those around her more and more. She will not be forgotten. This is the path she has ended up on, and she will **not** let herself be a failure again.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#3b9da5">Dusk Argentum#6530</p><p class="time">2021-02-19</p> <p class="message">For the first time in what feels like months, Dew has returned to her room at the Guild. Though her most recent quest was only a few days long, it felt like an eternity.
The stress of it had really begun to wear on her.

***&quot;Geyser.&quot;*** *She whispers, and uncorks her Decanter.*
As the water forcefully bursts out of her Decanter, she Controls it lazily, catching it and moving it around in the air. Her thoughts were elsewhere, though.

She worried about her performance on that quest. From the moment they departed on the airship, she had failed to aid her team when their ship&#x27;s sail had been torn, though her specialty was working with cloth and fabric. When she had discovered that Darcy was under the Lord&#x27;s enchantment, she had failed to lift it. During the talks with the Lord, she had failed to glean anything new... And had failed to recognize his fey nature.

She sighs, and recollects more failures.

The moment they had descended into the catacombs, she had failed to save the Lord&#x27;s servant, despite being instructed not to let her die. She had failed to convince her to hang on to her will to live, despite her rousing speech. She had failed to recognize that the servant was still mortally wounded despite her brief respite from being dead, and she had failed to save her again.

She had failed to help her allies when their memories were stolen. At the time, she thought that she had failed them the greatest... Their betrothals and their memories of recent times had left them. She was even briefly painted as an enemy, due to their lack of recognition of her.

**&quot;Am I truly... so forgettable..?&quot;** *She asks herself.*

Perhaps she was. She was supposed to be good at healing, good at weaving, good at helping. And she had failed to do all of these on multiple accounts. She wondered if she should return home... Perhaps the life of an adventurer was not for her.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#3b9da5">Dusk Argentum#6530</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">*About an hour passes, and Dew hears a whistle from the window. Iya is standing there, alongside another bird; a red cardinal with duller plumage. Dew stops her writing for a moment, gets up from her desk.* **&quot;Welcome back, Iya. And welcome to you, cardinal friend.&quot;** *She smiles softly at the new bird.* **&quot;If I may be so imposing, I would like to ask you to deliver a message for me. The recipient lives in Waterdeep, do you think this is a distance you could safely cross?&quot;** *The cardinal and Iya whistle back and forth for a moment before the cardinal chirps affirmatively. Dew interprets it as an agreement.* **&quot;Splendid! I need you only wait a moment.&quot;**
*She takes this moment to channel this newfound bond with this bird into an active magic, summoning up the same amount of power typically allotted to potent healing and weaving it into the Animal Messenger spell. For the time being, Dew and the cardinal are on the same wavelength.* **&quot;There is a woman in Waterdeep; a dark-skinned elf with eyes as green as the grass and wearing a scarf as blue as the sea. I need you to give her the following message:&quot;**
<blockquote>asciidoc
= Your dew drop is safe
= with the Ashflower Guild; I
= miss and love you much.
</blockquote>
*The cardinal accepts the message, flits over to the rapidly melting cup of ice made earlier by Dew, sips from the water within, and flies off, out of the window, through the woods just outside, and out of sight. Dew returns to her parchment and invokes Shape Water again to freeze the melting cup back into place and replenishes its contents with another stream from her Decanter. She has many plans for her weaving here, and they begin with a wonderful tapestry to adorn her door. She continues her writing, her plans and design of said tapestry, taking comfort in the knowledge that her mother will soon know that she is safe.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#3b9da5">Dusk Argentum#6530</p><p class="time">2020-07-22</p> <p class="message">*Not long after her fight with the angel in the monster pit, Dew finds her way to her room. While opening her door, she stops for a moment and observes just how plain it is.* **&quot;I will have to make something to amend that...&quot;** *She mutters to herself as she steps inside.*
*She has not been with the guild for long, so her room is mostly bare, save for the basic furniture that came within the room. She walks over to the window and opens it, feeling a gentle breeze from outside flow across her face and throughout the room for a moment before subsiding.*
*She reaches to the Decanter of Endless Water strapped to her side and uncorks it. She points the lip of the decanter upwards, and a whisper escapes her mouth,* ***&quot;Stream.&quot;*** *with the decanter responding immediately. She uses Shape Water to siphon off a bit of the stream, freezes it to create a cup of sorts, and siphons off a little more to fill the cup with the fresh water, as the stream tapers off the last few drops into the cup. She takes a sip and sets the cup down on the desk before sitting down on her bed.*
*Dew focuses for a moment, channeling her power... After this moment, a blue jay appears on her windowsill. This blue jay looks like a standard blue jay one would find in the forests along the Sword Coast, except that this one has an odd, violet-colored drop-shaped plume of feathers on its breast. Dew sees the jay, and smiles.* **&quot;I am sorry to summon you so far from where I last did, but much has happened since, friend Iya. Shall I tell you a story?&quot;** *The bird whistles in an affirmative way, and Dew describes her fights alongside the members of this guild against the Steel Predator and the Battle Angel. The bird listens attentively the whole time. After finishing the story, Dew smiles to the jay.* **&quot;May I ask a task of you? I need you to go find one of your kind. I must send word to my mother.&quot;** *With this, Iya flies off.*</p></li>
