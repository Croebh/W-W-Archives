Wave looked up to Zyth and gift her a smile wich, kinda thanks to their ordeal, was more expressive now since it also widened their mouth to a comfortable level now. Before that, teaspoons and little bites was everything that Wave could realy fit through the taut lips they had been made with but now, at least that was not a problem anymore.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2021-04-06</p> <p class="message">*Vae was looking over the... whatever it was Wave had coughed up the night before.

&quot;Dear Zyth and Vae.

I am sorry that I am not here when you read this but Waterdeep needs me. I go on another quest and this time it is for a place I hold very dear to my heart. I made you some pancakes as an apology for me not being here when you come back. 
There are things we need to talk about once we are all together again. Until then,

In Love
Wave

The draconic being puts their staff aside and walk towards the bathroom again, letting the dress slide from their shoulders and letting out a sigh of freedom. As they walk past the big mirror, Wave stopped. The draconic being looked at their reflection and placed their slender hands tenderly onto their stomach, running their hand over their stomach and letting out a melancholic sigh before they walk over to the bathroom door and enters it after a testing knock to not just walk into someone.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-03-01</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>

Their huge wings giving them enough lift to just glide laziely as they tried to calm themselfs down. Wave didn&#x27;t dislike what Zyth had done but the feeling they had experienced because of it. Wave let out another sigh as they looked over to the Guild Building as they just glide through the sky undisturbed. Up here it was peacefull, serene and relaxing. Sometimes Wave forgott thst they could fly just to relax and not for just a advantage in battle. 

After another few rounds around the building, Wave slowly glides towards the Window they exited, flapping their wings very slowly and carefully as they approach before latching onto the windowsil and pull themselfs inside again.

He felt tempted to hand off a scrap or two to Ace, but realized he hadn&#x27;t yet gotten around to working on that finery. Not long after the dishes were neatly set aside, and Vae concluded he needed to do some maintenance.

He fished out two packets, one of black tea for himself and one of chamomile for Wave before turning on his kettle and grabbing two mugs from the same drawer.* 

*Vae&#x27;s utensils were kept in the topmost drawer of his workbench while still at waist level, sorted by the type of utensil and how long they were.

Maybe they needed to explore their emotions more but... The last time they tried that nothing had come to fruition from that. The thought was shoved aside as they just lay there, their head resting ontop of that of Vae with a content look on their elongated muzzle as they nuzzled into the warm fur of the cute yeenificer.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-10-06</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>ini

It was nearly enough for them to just slide into a light slumber, not noticing the discomfort the Gnoll was experiencing. The draconic figure was just there, rubbing their lower jaw against the top of Vae&#x27;s head, nuzzling deeply into the soft fur.

Wave heared the mutterd words but couldn&#x27;t tell what they were about so the lanky dragonborn just said nothing. Instead, they took their free hand and arm and wrapped it around Vae and softly ran it through Vae&#x27;s fur again. There wasn&#x27;t much sound coming from Wave besides from their controlled and silent breathing as well as the low volume ticking coming from their chest, paired with the occasional rusling of their wings and their long tail lazily running over the sheets of the bed.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-25</p> <p class="message">*Vae smiled to himself as he snuggled against Wave, having curled himself into a ball now just because they were that big. Granted, he was fairly average height but that didn&#x27;t change the fact Wave towered over him- even if he stood up straight. Not that he cared- he liked being the little spoon quite a bit, and just spooning in general.*

*His train of thought was interrupted by a sharp pain from his left arm.* &quot;Not this again..&quot; *He mutters as he holds Wave&#x27;s hand.

Vae deserved more then Wave could give him but they would do their best in keeping the small, fluffy and snuggle starved Gnoll happy. The daconic figure just kept rubbi g Vae&#x27;s soft fur and back with slow and soft strokes, leaning their head against his and closing their piercing pink eyes.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-23</p> <p class="message">*Vae let his eyes close as he was burritoed, content just letting Wave pet him- He couldn&#x27;tve minded anything more.

This was very nice and Wave greatly enjoyed that. It was one thing to be loved by many and share such a tender and soft moment with someone who just likes you for being you. Slowly, Wave raises one of their huge wings and starts to envelop and burritos the yeen into it while going to fully embrace Vae, keeping him warm with their very warm, scalie body.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-22</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That&#x27;d be nice, since you&#x27;re not busy and all...&quot;** *Vae smiles as he returns to the silence, content to just sit there and spoon with them. He nuzzled his snout into the crook of their neck, exhaling in a soft sigh. He felt like he might as well be on cloud nine, absolutely elated that it was just the two of them cuddling here, Ace off by Vae&#x27;s workbench having curled up and simply observing the pair. The mech looked rather proud of himself, happy for them.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2020-09-22</p> <p class="message">*Wave chuckles again, a wierd sound coming from the tall and lanky draconic being for sure.* **&quot;Then let&#x27;s stay like this for a while.

It was weird that Vae didn&#x27;t get much attention like this. In Waves mind, Vae was a very nice and soft person that deserved some fondness like this in bis life. Maybe this was something Wave could give him. It was something they had to ponder about while they just held him against their side.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-22</p> <p class="message">*Vae grins sheepishly as he returns the gesture, putting his head in the crook of Wave&#x27;s neck.* **&quot;..that&#x27;s alright.

Wave let out a very rare chuckle until Vae could feel the warm and scalie form of Wave brushing against him, the long slender arms reaching around the gnolls waist and giving him a very soft hug.* **&quot;Thats why I am asking if there is something in return.

Staring up at the ceiling the artificer&#x27;s eyes glazed over as his mind wandered to various places.*

*...And then he fell asleep.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-20</p> <p class="message">*Ace definitely looked smug in that moment. Even with his robotic features, they were still carefully hand-welded, and solely by Vae&#x27;s own paws- and built for expression. The mechahyena looked very amused watching his lamenting creator.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-20</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Stupidfeelingsmakingmefeelthings.&quot;** *He pouts, crossing his arm over his chest as he slumps into his chair. Ace almost seems to.. laugh, at this.* 

**&quot;Don&#x27;t look so smug!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-20</p> <p class="message">*Besides, if his guesses were correct, it was that they were just friends anyway and that&#x27;s how it&#x27;d stay. They&#x27;d really have to hang out more so he could tell his feelings to go shove it. Ugh... Vae gently banged his head against the sturdy bench.* **&quot;Useless! Empty! Brain!&quot;** *He bemoans as Ace shoots him a glare of annoyance. Vae rubs the sore spot, sighing out again.* 

**&quot;... it&#x27;s creepy, right? Please tell me it is boy, maybe that&#x27;ll get my mind off of it... They probably forgot about me anyway.&quot;** *A yip in response.*

**&quot;Ugh, but... I know. Still doesn&#x27;t mean I can&#x27;t feel bad about it!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-20</p> <p class="message">*After some time thinking, Vae was slouched over his desk- as usual. The artificer was completely, genuinely, extraordinarily.. bored. He hadn&#x27;t felt inspired to work on a new project, and busied himself with the general upkeep of his prosthetic limb- his thumb had been acting up lately, which was never a good sign. A couple of screws stuck out of his mouth like little pieces of wheat as he fiddled with the parts in the joint, working slowly but not nearly as enthusiastic as he was about his other projects. It was just maintenance, after all. He sighed through grit teeth, setting the screwdriver in his still flesh-and-bone paw  down as he likewise let all three of the screws in his mouth fall into his lap before putting them on his desk as well.*

*Clearing some room on the eternally messy workbench Vae figured now was a better time than ever to take a moment&#x27;s rest. He laid his head down, mind wandering absently to his jacket that hung on the wall, and the House Cannith patch sewn to the left sleeve, the gorgon on the back staring at him with its bright red eyes and fuming expression. It was there that he felt himself staring off into space, his mind wandering to his encounter with Wave in the arena that.. somehow turned into a tea/cuddle session. He hated to admit it, but he knew he hadn&#x27;t been able to stop thinking about it.*

*...Not that he&#x27;d really ever had feelings for anyone before. Nobody from his clan had particularly interested him (and vice versa, since he is kind of a loser.), and others tended to complain about the amount he shed. But Wave..they sat with him silently and petted him as he&#x27;d mulled over the mystery that was their origin. He&#x27;d never really done that with, or for, anyone else before. It completely baffled him, but at the same time he knew he was a touch starved sucker. There was a reason behind Ace&#x27;s creation, after all. He wouldn&#x27;t say he was in... no, nevermind. That&#x27;d be ridiculous, and creepy. They&#x27;d only interacted once!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-09-20</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-04</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>ini

He was gushing slightly.. maybe. A lot. But even then his thoughts were still toward Wave&#x27;s peculiar origin and how they suddenly made infinitely more sense. The sword in their tail, the metallic feeling.. of course.

Using Daelkyr rituals to sculpt flesh and the magic of artifice to create the perfect bio-mechanical warbeast.

Until next time.&quot;** *Wave says, pulling their slender hand back over Vaes lower jaw and chin before standing up straight again. The androgynus form of Wave turned around and started to walk towards the door with gracefull steps and a noticable sway in their hips while their anatomy fixed itself again after retracting their tail blade.

It might be not the right thing to do for someone that just met but Wave did it regardless.

He&#x27;d always thought his fur was too coarse.

This was nice even though this was ment to help Wave to find some anywers but instead he found themselfs trapped by a fluffy Gnoll and his faithfull robot companion. Wave hesitates just for a moment before they lift their slender hand and start running it through the soft fur ontop of the artificers head. Giving Vae some headpats and scritches behind the ears.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-09-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;O-okay then.&quot;** *Vae says, relaxing beside them, listening to the clockwork ticking in their chest. He drummed his hand on his prosthetic, the metal softly clinking as he struck it.

You would probably enjoy the comic books about my adventures then.&quot;** *Wave says before taking another sip. By now every word hurt a little so they tried to conserve their voice a little bit. Waves wing pulls the gnoll a little closer until Vae rests against their warm chestscales (perception dc 10).* **&quot;I am gratefull for your help Vae.

It was nice of the Gnoll to provide Wave with something to soothe their sore throat and it didn&#x27;t take long before Wave took another sip after carefully blowing over the tea.*  **&quot;At least I think it is...

A spoon or two should suffice.&quot;** *They say, waiting for him to put the honey in.* **&quot;And well...

He takes the lid off, and fills it up a bit more before turning on the heating mechanism and waiting, never standing still- tapping his foot, wagging his tail, sometimes rubbing his left arm where the stump would be.*

*He winced slightly as a wave of phantom pains washed over before it quickly passed as the water finished heating. Vae threw the original bag away in the tiny garbage can under the desk before retrieving a new one and dropping it in with the string hanging out before walking back to with with Wave and burrito again.* **&quot;Here you go.

Absentmindedly bobbing the string with one hand as he plays with the little goat statuettes in his other the question of where they came from continues through his mind.

They stay there as the tea finishes steeping and cooling, after which Vae quickly sips up the drink. Maybe testing this new armblade would help him figure it out, he thinks.

And there is no need to be embarrassed by your natural state.&quot;</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-08-27</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Because it&#x27;s loud and I&#x27;m.. a bit embarrassed, really..&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#1abc9c">Neutralista#8895</p><p class="time">2020-08-27</p> <p class="message">*Taarka smirks.* &quot;Oh, why hide the laugh?&quot; *He asks.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-08-27</p> <p class="message">*He giggles in turn, a loud and boistrous noise before he cups his paws over his mouth in a sheepish smile.*  **&quot;..That&#x27;s fair.&quot;**  *He says, still with an awkward smile.* **&quot;I-if I didn&#x27;t have something to keep myself busy with all the time, I think I&#x27;d go crazy...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#1abc9c">Neutralista#8895</p><p class="time">2020-08-27</p> <p class="message">&quot;I&#x27;ve turned my attention from the matters of war to more esoteric subjects... even if I apply those subjects to combat because I cannot keep myself still for very long.&quot; *He laughs.* &quot;I still have the blood of a soldier in me.&quot;</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-08-26</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That... huh.

*his eyes go dark for a moment as he goes back...* &quot;I stood at the base of the watchtower. My guul&#x27;dar, bugbears, had taken the tower above by sneaking their way up the outside of it. The Aundairan wandslingers did not stand a chance. My goblins scouted ahead and already reported incoming Broom Riders. I climbed up the tower myself and took aim, while my bugbears prepared their javelins. It was... magnificent. As one, we fired. Well-placed shots knocked all seven of the Riders off their mounts and plummeting to their demise. Being Broom Riders, they had stockpiles of blast disks on their bodies. They detonated on impact with the ground and incinerated the remains. Nothing was left but their bones.&quot;</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-08-23</p> <p class="message">**&quot;No  doubt about that..&quot;** *Vae muses, absentmindedly patting Ace&#x27;s head.* **&quot;But.. what exploits?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#1abc9c">Neutralista#8895</p><p class="time">2020-08-23</p> <p class="message">*Taarka laughs.* &quot;Trust me, war is anything but interesting while you are in it.

Unlocking it the artificer was more than surprised to see a hobgoblin- it wasn&#x27;t like he&#x27;d seen many of them before, but nonetheless a familiar face was.. relieving.

Outside, the old hobgoblin stands with a small smile on his face. He&#x27;d heard rumors going around that there was another Eberronian around, and he felt obligated to come say hello. Especially since Taarka&#x27;s time during the War was as a mercenary, he did not feel any particular attachment to any particular nation, so he felt he had a chance of at least getting along with anyone from Eberron.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-08-22</p> <p class="message">*Vae settles into his room with his few belongings in hand and on his person, looking around in approval. Slinging his messenger bag off of his shoulders and tossing it to the ground with an unceremonious thud, the artificer sprawls out onto the comfortable mattress and blankets for the first time in what felt like eons. He of course had plenty of days of sleeping over desks in his future, but this time it could be of his own volition. Ace jumped onto the bed beside his master as Vae turns over to stare up at the ceiling. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t immensely fascinated by the humongous weapon in the lobby.. the gears in his head had begun to turn and blueprints were being mentally drafted. He would create a smaller version, something a bit more handheld... a sidearm! Considering he had a crossbow intended for someone much beefier than he was that he’d.. done much altering to for his main weapon, a sidearm might be good to carry.. but what of the source or material fired? Perhaps small scrap metal pieces or some kind of magic? Maybe even electricity... He couldn’t say for certain yet. Vae had the typical look on his face when he was in an inventing mood- a slight glaze to his eyes but a thoughtful look on his features. It was a look Ace was very familiar with.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2020-08-22</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/746431302995279922/746656818582781972/image0.jpg"/></li>
