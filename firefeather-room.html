It was nice to not be angry or depressed again and now she just enjoyed being all fiery colored and happy again.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;What else do you need Rhogar? I made cleared half the table, a shelf you can use and prepared a soft and fluffy cushion for your seat.&quot;**|| *She explains as she just pulls herself onto the tabletop, sitting down and obviously leaning back enticingly.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-01-20</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>

Of course their views and traditions would be different, they came from vastly different societies [Draconic] **”Of course my dear, cultural differences are bound to be present. But I am willing to work through them if you are.”** he says with honest conviction though knowing in the back of his mind that it was certainly possibly that they may be incompatible.**”Companionship, I can give”** he says looking at her swollen eyes and tear stained plumage while his own seemed to swell up and release a droplet or two. **”I can be a shoulder to cry on, a sounding board for crazy ideas, a wealth of factoids to help you make decisions as a voice grounded in logic and rationalism.

Letting him talk and explain though the first parts she didn&#x27;t realy get despite hearing it in Draconic but Rhogar certainly got the point across. The lizardfolk had steeled herself to break up with Rhogar once and for all before he came, letting all the rage consume her and cloud her judgment but... Hearing his long drawn apology, the explanation of how and why he was the way he was melted her heart and made her shiver in shame. Tears ran down her cheek, revealing her firery scales and plumage where the tears ran or dripped before she got up from the Bed she was sitting on and looks at Rhogar.* **&quot;I am sorry Rhogar...&quot;** *She says in a shaky voice, speaking draconic, ringing seemingly with her own emotions and lets Rhogar hanging for a long moment before Firefeather just walks up and slumps against him, burrying her soot coverd face against his chest shaking.* **&quot;I had no idea... that I caused you so much confusion... And anxiety...&quot;** *She said and gulped deeply, not looking up to meet his gaze.* **&quot;And... I am sorry that I made you feel preasured... It is just... In my tribe... there is not something like... what do you call it... I think marriage? We just... We just take a mate and then we are family...&quot;** *She says, trying to explain why she saw the two as a family.

I enjoy our time together, birdwatching, reading, snuggling, playing with fire and the like.

Maybe this would go better if they were both looking to make amends. ||**”You see my dear, if it wasn’t painstakingly obvious before I have not engaged in coitus before nor have I ever had the interest. Even that night as I arrived at this domicile I was simply being courteous. But your mellifluous voice and exigent advances awoke something inside me that I did not know was there.”** he takes a breath searching for the words. For ones that were true but would also soften their edges and mitigate the damage they might do. **”You said earlier we were family and spoke of love. I admire the conviction with which you spoke and it is obvious that you are very in tune with your emotions being able to express them and harness them into the magic that you can perform. Unfortunately, I am lacking in that department and have shut that part out for so long to make room for arcane sigils and incantations that I can’t seem to access it anymore.”** at some point Firefeather would likely try to interject but he had to get this out now otherwise he may never do so, he would put his hand up and say **”Please, let me finish”** in a quiet and sincere tone, then continues **”I don’t know how I FEEL and not just about you but about anything. Feeling things is useless in academia, facts are what matter. Who knows the most obscure trivia about the the year DR 207? Who has the most complex arcane ritual? What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow? It left no room or time to worry about feelings. All that mattered was being the best, the smartest if some feelings were hurt along the way, well, too bad, guess you were not cut out for the job. I guess what I am trying to say is that assuming we are family after a few short months together is frightening for me as it is just moving too quickly for my solitary nature.”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-01-14</p> <p class="message">*Firefeather sits down on the bed and looks at the ground and nods.* [Draconic]||**&quot;It&#x27;s... ok...

She wasn&#x27;t expecting anything from Rhogar especialy not when she was his first. All the ones that were unexperienced were like this as first or realy clumsy so she prefered this far more. She rubs her headfeathers against him softly as she looks up and rubs her snout against his.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;**|| *She asks softly. Some times it just needed a little push in the right direction for a male to actualy take charge with her.

She started to rub his chest with her hand as shee coo&#x27;s softly. She didn&#x27;t know if this was awkward to him or not but for her it was just nice to be able to share her warmth eith someone.

She let out a soft chirp as she rubbed her head on his throat and jaw. Her boddy warmed up a little and send a very comfortable warmth into Rhogars body. It realy felt like comming back home from a day in the cold before sitting down at a warm hearth that welcomed one home. The female lizardfolk placed one hand on his chest and just leaned against him, listening to his breath.* [Draconic] ||**&quot;Do you like my warmth Rhogar?&quot;**|| *She asked softly, not knowing for sure that she was probably the first woman that came this close to him like this.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2020-07-26</p> <p class="message">*Okay so she definitely wants to have coitus.* he starts to sweat a bet and swallows nervously. *Breathe Rhogar breathe.

Seeing his brain visibly at work made her feel... amused. She hadn&#x27;t thought she could do that to a male but Rhogar was so different then the males she usualymated with. They were all good hunters or warriors but Rhogar was a thinker. And Thinkers got exiled in the tribal sociaty of those lizardfolk that were still tribal. Thinking was the reason why there was only one god left in the lizardfolk beliefe system but to Firefeather, thinkers were interesting. She just looks at him before he speaks up before she responds in draconic in a very chirping tone.* ||**&quot;You intrigue me in many ways Rhogar... Other females of my kind wouldn&#x27;t even look at you...&quot;**|| *She suddendly leans in very close, her fluffy chest rubbing against his robes as she nuzzles the top of her head against his throat and under his jaw.*||**&quot;But I...

It can’t be. Females show signs of those types of things I’ve read about it.

She had no Idea how he thought courtship hadvto be conducted. She just knew that, if she saw someone she wanted as a mate that just asking them was usualy enough or the tribe decided with ritual combat who would get to mate with her.

He could feel the warmth radiating fire and started thinking about what spells she may have used to conjure the unusual flames. *Create Bonfire perhaps? No that would be much larger.

Perhaps she lit the fire then altered it like I can with water. that was probably it, much like she did back in the tower.* [Draconic]||**”Thank you. I AM trying but no one ever seems to notice.

A bed, a desk and a small closet for personal belongings. Firefeather hadn&#x27;t done anything yet to make this feel more like home... or comfortable realy. She stood theee in her room and sulked after her little excursion into the wizards tower. She niffled a little about how she was treated and turned towards the fireplace. She took off the band of leather she was weaeing around her chest and shook it out, revealing that it was more of a whole leather mat, wrapped around her chest. She places it in front and sits down, looking into the empty fire place. After a moment or two she chucks a few pieces of firewood inside before using her magic to ignite the wood. This building was cold and without the people that lived here it would be a pretty sad and dead place. The lizardfolk reaches towards her bundle of peppers and pulls out one of her red ones and starts absentmindedly chewing on it. A single tear rolls down her cheek. She was neither a kid nor was she dumb. Common was just such a complicated language compared to the spirit language or the tongue of her people. It wasn&#x27;t her fault that she only spoke it broken. She had seen that Rhogar didn&#x27;t ment to hurt her but it still stung like a dagger in her chest. Firefeather curled up on the leather mat and started to sniffle more. She hoped that that Dragonborn had at least the decency to come to her later... If not she would never forgivr him even though... Even though she wanted to see more of his flames... Wanted to feel it and she wanted to know if... If there was more fire in him then just that what he could breath.*</p></li>
