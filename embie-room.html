A small sign to show Zee just how happy he was to hear such. That he wouldn&#x27;t be opposed meant that there was chance. Meant that there was choice. And he couldn&#x27;t stop himself from feeling the ardent grasp of faith pulling his own design together that much more firmly...* <blockquote-inline>&quot;All in due time, Zee. I just want you to know this wish of mine...&quot;</blockquote-inline> *The hand on his leg withdrew, clutching at the one kneading at his chassis. A small squeeze of appreciation was followed by his mechanical voice returning to the usual tone of focus:* <blockquote-inline>&quot;As for the matter at hand, I sincerely do not know. My wager is that they have already retreated to somewhere safe... That is the smartest move right now. And we must do as such. Find as many of the others that remained in the Guild, and relocate.&quot;</blockquote-inline></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message">*Zee smiled, rubbing his hands along Embie&#x27;s chassis like one would give another a massage almost, his troubled expression easing somewhat.* **&quot;I see. That sounds like a wise decision. Do you have any idea where they&#x27;ve gone?&quot;** *He meeps as Embie runs a hand along his leg, feeling his face flush again.* **&quot;Oh, oh my. Um... You see.. I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed..&quot;** *Though a nagging feeling at the back of his head told him as another cog in the Design, he shouldn&#x27;t be.. shouldn&#x27;t be trying such things, especially not with a conduit of the One Machine&#x27;s will.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#729974">ᴇɴᴛʀᴏᴘɪᴀ#1178</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message"><blockquote-inline>&quot;I suppose you can only imagine the toll it has taken on this old soul of mine to discover such... And I am grateful for even this small effort to comprehend.&quot;</blockquote-inline> *Embie turned his head, the lights of his eyes going out. Just like... closing one&#x27;s eyes, to fully admire the softness of Zee&#x27;s gesture ~~and thighs~~.* <blockquote-inline>&quot;What we need to do now, is understand what happened of the others, and, well, yes. Regroup. Madam Onyx and Kelzyr are undoubtedly in good hands, and if they are alongside the strongest of the guild, they are also at their strongest. If I am able to provide at least a tenth of what I know regarding warfare towards the talents of our fellows, the tide may just turn in our favor.&quot;</blockquote-inline>

*One of his hands went down, gingerly caressing the top of the Cleric&#x27;s leg.* <blockquote-inline>&quot;What blossoms between us is no relationship, Zee. Not in a troubled time such as this. But... Once we make it out of it,&quot;</blockquote-inline> *once, not if,* <blockquote-inline>&quot;... I would like it to be.

That&#x27;s quite troublesome, Embie.. and not the type of news I imagine anyone is particularly thrilled with..&quot;** *He sighed, placing his hands on Embie&#x27;s shoulders as he continued to prop the warforged up on his ~~thicc~~ lap.* **&quot;It is alright. I suppose such a revelation is.. is quite a shock, to once be thought emotionlesss but only for that to not be the case. But, I understand. I take it we&#x27;re to gather our numbers and what have you so that we may counterattack, yes? But... I cannot afford to lose you either. Such a conduit of the One Machine lost in this conflict, where I am able to intervene would be my greatest shame. Not as a cleric of the One Machine, but also as.. as we are. I do not know the word for.. our relationship?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#729974">ᴇɴᴛʀᴏᴘɪᴀ#1178</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message">*Focus, Embie:* <blockquote-inline>&quot;There is a massive armata gathering at Guild grounds. An unnatural amount of guards, and from what I could see, an equal of amount of people who don&#x27;t fight with steel... They are seeking the bounties of the veterans, and to overthrow everyone else. If... No, -by- now, my note has certainly reached our higher-ups. They know of all that I could learn from the enemy... I have entrusted two of our allies for it.&quot;</blockquote-inline> *His other hand reached up, holding Zee&#x27;s face between his wooden palms as gently as one held the bed of dry hay for the growing ember of a bonfire.* <blockquote-inline>&quot;I am so sorry... For earlier. I have thought on it all day... I was scared. But now the fear of losing you outweighs any other doubt in this soul of mine. We need to leave... Seek safety first, and regroup. I can&#x27;t afford to risk you until we are certain to fight back, Zee...&quot;</blockquote-inline></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#ff9aff">Actual E-Gremlin#7346</p><p class="time">2021-07-24</p> <p class="message">*Zee nudged the door shut as much as he could from his position, readjusting the way he sitting.* **&quot;I see..

Closed-er. Er.* <blockquote-inline>&quot;I believe we are safe here, but not for long... This should let me speed you up to everything...&quot;</blockquote-inline> *Though fixed and operational, he remained on the floor. Reaching up to stroke the Cleric&#x27;s cheek as well.*

For a tense moment, Embie remained unresponsive, until the lights of his eyes sparked into life again, and his joints rattled and tightened. He puffed up, jaw going slack, and all that was needed to fit the criteria of a man **desperately** gasping for air, was the sound of the actual gasp.* <blockquote-inline>&quot;Zee...?&quot;</blockquote-inline> *His tone was worried, and yet, impossibly relieved to see him again.* <blockquote-inline>&quot;Zee, you&#x27;re...

*Embie&#x27;s hands dropped to the desk, shaking in exertion. He was so focused in typing, so focused in passing the message forward, that not once had his eyes fallen on the page. His worry was on the keys; making sure to hit every single right one without mistake. This was crucial... He yanked the note from the type writer, and immediately set out towards the door-- and, standing up a little too quickly, he **fell** again. Once more, beginning the effort to crawl towards the half-open door...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#729974">ᴇɴᴛʀᴏᴘɪᴀ#1178</p><p class="time">2021-07-23</p> <p class="message">*To say he walked through the door would have been a disrespectfully wrong euphemism to the situation. Embie stumbled pathetically through it, barely catching himself on the doorknob before his chassis could have met the floorboards. His internal gyroscope felt as if it&#x27;d been put through a chainsaw&#x27;s motor, and he could barely hold himself up. Sheer blunt force trauma sending his system into shock... He just needed to reach his desk... And reach out, he did; extending a trembling arm towards his chair. Only to fall all the way, losing his grasp on the door and dropping with a **loud [THUNK]** of metal slamming down. He groaned again, cursing the inefficiency of his own design to stay afloat. Things beyond his control... They did not matter now; he had control yet.*

*Embie mustered whatever force he still had left, and crawled forward. Forward, &#x27;til he could grab onto the seat of his desk&#x27;s chair. Oh, if only he had a face with which to smile with... The pride in his grin would have been unmatched... He pulled himself up, and sat; reached for a fresh sheet of paper, and weakly slid it into the typewriter. And, with shaking fingers, he hammered down into the keys... He wanted to prove Jimtiem right; and above all, he wanted Zee to be right as well. His part in the Grand Design of things was far, far from being the littlest cog...*

*Plucking the third page of his report from the typewriter, Embie took his imprint stamp, and &quot;signed&quot; down on an empty space. He took a short moment to read over the papers, and stack them in order. There was... no pride in what he had just written, but at the same time, there was no real regret. Out of sight, out of mind. In this case, it was out of mind altogether... Whatever bitterness he once had over the memory was promptly washed out by addressing it. Much like his time already spent in the Guild, and his consecutive failures, it was a good reminder that he had much more control now...*</p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857411826194448414/862072173179306004/stamp.png"/></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-07-05</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>

He&#x27;d met a lot more people since the last entry. Visited new places, done a couple of favours, even tried his best at sparring twice, and gambling, once. Needless to say, in all of the two of the latter mentioned tasks, he failed miserably. But the defeat and the misfortune of losing a couple of coins taught him very well. It was a good reminder of his humility. Among the new faces, was Gra&#x27;Grosh, an Orc that tended to the Guild&#x27;s garden with diligence. Z78, a cleric of the &quot;One Machine&quot;, whom he called &quot;Zee&quot; for the sake of respect and convenience, and to whom he&#x27;d lost one of the two duels. Mélanos, a very proficient fighter, was to whom he lost the second. There was Ashok, who would provide him with an upgrade as soon as he had enough money, and...

... Embie stopped, staring down at the typewriter&#x27;s keys. His bronze fingers floated motionless over the letters, hesitant to continue. He never once shied away from what he&#x27;d done, but treating it like someone&#x27;s entertainment felt... wrong. Maybe he just needed to be in the right mindset. The Forged pulled his hands away from the keys, and instead, reached into a small glass container on his desk, chock full of dried, sorted nuts he&#x27;d taken from the kitchen on his way up. 
A little less than a handful was more than enough, and he carefully sprinkled them by his writing machine. His squirrel buddy hurried to the treats, climbing up his leg like a speedy bullet! A small breath of fresh air to remind him he wasn&#x27;t the same mindless machine he was in Eberron... He was learning more, and more.

Now... where were we? Ah, yes. Finishing the entry, and then working on the report. Can&#x27;t get too distracted now...*

*First day, first report. A little more bare-bones on the details than he&#x27;d like it to be, but it would serve... Embie couldn&#x27;t stand to remain idle for too long, as he&#x27;d mentioned to the newest of his colleagues met. Doing something was a necessity; right now, it just so happened to be writing another entry to his personal recordings. A small run-down of his journey since his last, the fortunate encounter with the Guild, the names and faces he&#x27;d come to learn so far. Kjara, the gentle-but-firm soul that welcomed him. Rose, whose apparent tenacity was something he related to. Jake, a volatile one, but his heart was in the right place. And Onyx, only known thus far by name and spoken-of fierce. 

With a firm imprint of his stamp at the bottom of the small book page, Embie shook it gently, letting the ink dry before it was stored safely, between the pages of the book he kept in the drawer. First one of many, he hoped...

... Okay. It&#x27;s already time to go out and find something else to do.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#729974">ᴇɴᴛʀᴏᴘɪᴀ#1178</p><p class="time">2021-06-25</p><p class="message"></p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857411826194448414/858017182093148190/unknown.png"/></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#729974">ᴇɴᴛʀᴏᴘɪᴀ#1178</p><p class="time">2021-06-25</p><p class="message">*Just a couple of finishing touches, and it would surely start feeling like &#x27;home&#x27; in no time.

Maybe then he&#x27;d know how it felt like. Embie set to work as soon as he&#x27;d opened the door: now that everything had been clean, all he had to do was unpack and rearrange. Making sure to leave as little drag-marks on the wooden flooring as possible.

Eventually, his room had a feel for itself. It was simple and compact, but still cosy. His writing supplies, the quill and ink he&#x27;d barely ever used, were set besides the typewriter. His book of black cover was stashed neatly in the drawer by the side. And on the other end of the room, where a bed would be, there was instead a big sturdy workbench, just how he asked.*</p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857411826194448414/858017170441371658/unknown.png"/></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-06-24</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>

Whatever dust had gathered, Embie was swift to broom and sweep through it. The sheets on the bed have not escaped the ire of his duty either, and despite the absolute lack of use for a clean bed, they were changed for clean ones. The old &quot;laundry&quot; folded neatly into a smaller-than-a-pillow sized square. His pouch was left on the shelf, the desk neatly ordered with all of his writing and studying belongings. A small book, of black leather hard cape, lay amongst the quill and ink, and the sheet of parchment. Now, with nothing on himself but the keys to him room and the old, yet unused bedsheets, Embie locked his quarters up again, and set out towards the Lobby.

*The main building&#x27;s layout was-- or seemed to be-- pretty simple. Spacious but not quite void. He had to file a proper request for a furniture replacement, and ask a little more about his... possible &#x27;neighbours&#x27;.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#729974">ᴇɴᴛʀᴏᴘɪᴀ#1178</p><p class="time">2021-06-24</p> <p class="message">Home, sweet home.

It&#x27;s hard to really call something &#x27;home&#x27; when the real weight of the word couldn&#x27;t be measured in a lexicon&#x27;s definition. &quot;Home&quot; was an important thing to many people. Home was where some lived, home was where some grew; some lost their homes, others had never gotten to experience what a home felt like. Maybe Embie himself fell on the latter, quite to his knowledge. The number on the keys matched the numbers on the door, and with a turn and a click, he pushed it wide open. 

It looked in order.
He couldn&#x27;t quite tell if it was dusty or not, what with a lack of a sense of smell and whatnot.
A bed. Standard, of course. Right under the window.
A small shelf, and an equally compact desk.
It felt weird to have all of this for himself... Unusual. Whereas his equipment would have all been separated into a private compartment in the past, his compartment was now people-sized. Leaving the door open, Embie set his sights onto organizing. A quick clean-up. To leave his belongings in there, and make it somewhat presentable to those whose noses would definitely suffer if his newest quarters were just a dust pit.

*First thing&#x27;s first: leave door and window open to begin the clean-up.*</p></li>
