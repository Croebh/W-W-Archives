But inevitably she did, and her mind started to wonder about different scenarios, one of which terrified her though she didn&#x27;t express it openly. Miz&#x27;ri would see it in her eyes thought when Ashden would look up to her and stare in her eyes, the slightest tinge of fear there that probably was more obvious than the grave keeper even realized herself.* **&quot;Miz&#x27;ri, if I died...could you ever feel about someone else the way you do about me~ I&#x27;m not asking if you love me, I know you aren&#x27;t sure yourself, but I&#x27;m...I&#x27;m scared that you might not...~&quot;** *She tightens herself against Miz&#x27;ri, a tear in the corner of her eye she didn&#x27;t intend to shed.* **&quot;I&#x27;m scared you might not be able to love because of me~ If something happened to me~ I don&#x27;t want you to close your heart off to those feelings or the possibility of having them for someone else because of me~ I know its asking too much...especially right now...but the idea that you might never figure love out because of something happening to me...~&quot;** *She trails off but then looks up with a tender smile and tears streaming down her face.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t give up on those feelings...on exploring them...and trying to understand them, even if I&#x27;m not there~ Even if it isn&#x27;t with me~ I&#x27;m asking too much, I know, but I...I couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of you loosing a chance to feel love and be loved because of loosing me~ So even if this doesn&#x27;t last forever...don&#x27;t give up on that feeling...even if it hurts~&quot;** *She puts a hand on Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s chest, trying to let her know what feeling she meant, even if she was only sensing a ping of it within herself. She knew it as love but also knew Miz&#x27;ri might not understand it as that yet, if it was even there at all. She hoped it was anyway, even if only so the undying warlock could understand it, and feel it for someone, even if it wasn&#x27;t Ashden.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-20</p> <p class="message">Miz&#x27;ri returns the kiss, although a bit more mechanical in feel than she intended. This was all quite strange still, and she was sure this was one of those things that only happened once in your life, no matter how long it was. Whether this was for better or worse, she didn&#x27;t know, and figured she wouldn&#x27;t until it was over. So, instead of trying to figure out that much, she just returns to stroking her hair and relaxing in the coffin. **&quot;I see.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-19</p> <p class="message">*Ashden was surprised by the question, simply because it seemed a bit more ephemeral than some of the things Miz&#x27;ri had asked her, though she supposed it was just out of curiosity. Nope, it was cute. It was a cute question. Case closed. Ashden thought for a moment before trying to find the right things to say since, honestly, she wasn&#x27;t totally sure what normal dreaming was like. She never had, but the last night few nights had certainly felt like a dream. That, of course, wasn&#x27;t what she had meant but...*

**&quot;Dreaming...can be a lot of things~ Sometimes it&#x27;s like trying to remember things, but in the wrong order and in really abstract ways~ Sometimes its our minds trying to figure themselves out~ Sometimes its just us trying to escape the fear of sleep~ It can be fun, strange, nonsensical, and-&quot;** *She grips Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s clothes a little tight without realizing it.* **&quot;Sometimes it&#x27;s just fear~ Just all your fears and fears you don&#x27;t understand or even realize you have tormenting you~ But it always seems real~ That&#x27;s the best and scariest part about a dream; no matter how wonderful, weird, or terrifying they are, they seem real~&quot;** *She looks up at Miz&#x27;ri and smiles a genuine smile.* **&quot;Dreams supposedly can be nice, but I&#x27;m happy you don&#x27;t have to worry about nightmares~ But...I feel like these last two days with you, waking up with you beside me, are better than any dream could ever be~&quot;** *She leans in for a long, sweet kiss before nuzzling her nose a bit and staying close to her, gazing into her eyes. Those crimson orbs were like an ocean, and she wanted to dive into them. To see everything that they hid and more. She wanted to feel everything Miz&#x27;ri felt, even if it was cold logic, indifference, or anything else, but she hoped that maybe, just maybe, there was love somewhere in there. Or at least that she could learn how to love. Ashden wasn&#x27;t trying to teach her that...but if the other warlock happened to pick it up along the way, well, she wouldn&#x27;t complain.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-19</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That&#x27;s probably because they are dry, they&#x27;re the complete history of Netheril from the minds of Rhaugilath and Larloch. Of course, Rhaugilath mostly as he writes them, but Larloch reads each one over. I got the chance to read a few new chapters during my stay in his Crypt.&quot;** She keeps up the gentle motion, running her fingers through her hair, her fingertips lights grazing her scalp in a soothing motion. She lets the silence hang for a few minutes before speaking again. **&quot;What is it like, to dream?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">*It works. It really does. Feeling Miz&#x27;ri fingers gently touching her skin in an attempt to comfort her makes her feel like she&#x27;s floating. She makes a little noise of approval and presses against the girl&#x27;s hand longingly. Hearing the title of the book causes a reaction in Ashden, remembering the title from somewhere in her past. Right...Jorn...* **&quot;My friend Jorn read me one of those once~ He used to read to me a lot to help me fall asleep and ignore my nightmares~ I never had a big brother, but I also thought if I did I would want him to be like Jorn~ I don&#x27;t think he liked those books though~ Always said they were too dry~ He always said funny stuff like that~&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">Miz&#x27;ri brushes her fingers against Ashden&#x27;s scalp tenderly as the morose mood starts to overcome her, hoping the brief contact would pull her from sinking down too far. **&quot;I will keep that in mind should one arise. It&#x27;s not often however, and more often than not I need to handle it by myself due to matters Larloch considers sensitive, but if the opportunity arises, I will inform you.&quot;** She resumes petting her as normal, finding the motion to be nice as well, maybe this was a little of why Ashden preferred to give affection? **&quot;When I&#x27;m not dealing with Larloch directly, I often work through Rhaugilath due to his status. While he is another servitor lich, he is more important, as such, he tends to have much different tasks, if not is left alone to serve more as a prize than anything else. Many days, when not teaching me himself or in some way working for Larloch, he often can be found writing his books &quot;Of the Fall of Netheril&quot;, a good read if you can get to view it, which is hard given it&#x27;s locations.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">*Ashden can sense her respect for the lich, and is happy she has someone like that in her life. Having someone to look up to and respect, to push yourself to reach their level, someone who pushes you to be your best even if they don&#x27;t intend to. That was a nice thing to have. For Ashden it was the heroes from old stories, or her friends who never gave up even when things got tough. She always felt stronger when she was with them. She thinks about this and starts wondering what they all were doing now, and if they were as happy as she was.* **&quot;I&#x27;m happy you have people to look up to~ If you ever need help with your tasks just let me know~ I haven&#x27;t been on a quest in a long time, not since me and my friends decided to go our separate ways~&quot;** *She looks a little sad saying this but not in a depressed sort of way.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;He&#x27;s a complicated being. it&#x27;s impossible to categorize him beyond he is who he is. I respect him immensely, not only for his power, but for being who he is. While history has no end to tales of evil liches being slain for their awful ways and plans of world domination, Larloch is different.&quot;** It&#x27;s clear her words are genuine, that she respects him. Internally it&#x27;s as complicated as trying to explain the lich, and just as one can&#x27;t predict his next move, she cannot accurately describe why she respects him, though she was sure it was not a mind altering effect, she&#x27;d checked.

**&quot;Nevertheless, I enjoy working for him and having him as my teacher. If nothing else, he is an endless trove of knowlege, and he does not require much in return. On occasion he demands my removing of a &quot;threat&quot; to him.&quot;** She air quotes the word threat, knowing no such thing existed. **&quot;Not a threat really, so much as someone, or more often something, he needs dealt with in some fashion. He has his reasons, as do we all, and it is a small payment for what I receive.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">*Ashden looks at her and can&#x27;t help but smile, hugging her tightly. She really did care...or at least Ashden chose to believe that. She could see how a name like Larloch could eventually devolve into warlock, but she could tell from Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s words that she shouldn&#x27;t make the mistake. Still, it sounded like Larloch might not be as nice as she thought he was...but then again madness can have that effect on people...and sentient magic swords.* **&quot;I won&#x27;t, and thank you~&quot;** *She snuggles and lightly kisses the her snuggle buddy.* **&quot;I won&#x27;t put you through that~&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;It&#x27;s not his house, it&#x27;s the fallen Netherese flying enclave, it was called Orbedal. It was Rhaugilath&#x27;s before, but when Larloch showed up he was able to subdue him and take it.&quot;** She starts her explanation and continues to pet her hair. This was easy, just what she knew, her patron was a known to her. She didn&#x27;t have to think about how to feel, if she should, when she should, what emotions she was meant to feel, and if she was meant to, it was nice in that it was well within her broad comfort circle, whereas emotions were not.

**&quot;It was called Larloch&#x27;s Crypt, over time the name was corrupted into Warlock&#x27;s Crypt, and many a minstrel have made the mistake of reciting the ballad &quot;The Warlock King&quot; within the surrounding areas.&quot;** She looks to Ashden again, no mirth in her eyes, she seems deadly serious. **&quot;Do not press that. He finds it less funny than I am sure you do, and if he heard you say it, he would abduct you, and he would kill you, nothing I do or say would stop him. I&#x27;ve seen him do horrible things to the people who made this folly, I don&#x27;t want to see it happen to you, do you understand?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">*Ashden listens intently to all of this and can&#x27;t help but smile. Larloch sounded like fun. A lot of fun, as did Rhaungilath, and Warlock&#x27;s Crypt. She liked  the Ashflower Crypt and loved Greymourn, but she wouldn&#x27;t mind visiting Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s home. She did wonder though if Miz&#x27;ri realized that Warlock&#x27;s Crypt was that for her: a home. Maybe she was being too whimsical, which wouldn&#x27;t be out of character for her, but it sounded like Miz&#x27;ri had something special with her patron.* **&quot;He sounds a lot nicer than Myrkul...but reminds me a lot of Greymourn~ I wonder if they would get along~&quot;** *She smiled and played a little with Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s hand as she spoke, a though passing through her mind as she looks toward the other woman curiously.* **&quot;If he doesn&#x27;t like being called a warlock, then why does he call his house Warlock&#x27;s Crypt~&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I had been researching him for some time, it naturally came up when I was looking to see where my knowlege of Kiaransalee&#x27;s necromantic rituals could be useful. I wanted power, power enough to defend myself if my old house ever sent an assassin my way. Once I had decided I would travel to Warlock&#x27;s crypt to seek him out. Once I arrived I offered what knowledge I had in exchange for tutorage by him, and given he was in a whimsical mood at the time, he offered to be my patron.&quot;** It was rather more complicated than that of course, getting to Warlock&#x27;s Crypt, and then through it to speak with Larloch was it&#x27;s own trial, but one that didn&#x27;t need recounting if not simply because it was a lot of things she didn&#x27;t consider vital to the tale. **&quot;Being is warlock is.. well I cannot compare it to being the warlock of any other powerful being, so I only have him to go off of. However, I would consider it pleasant enough. My talks with him are a coin flip, either he is a kind and whimsical teacher, or other times a mad and raving old meanspirited lich. Though, despite barking orders and threats at me, he would never hurt me. Regardless of my usefulness to him, he made a promise to teach me, and that I would be safe from him and his if I did not betray him.&quot;** She looks down to Ashden&#x27;s eyes and get&#x27;s a serious glint in them. **&quot;Say what you will, besides falsely referring to him as a warlock, that will get you killed brutally and surely. Beside that however, he keeps his promises, no matter what. No matter what mood he is in, he always believes that his word is one of his most important possessions, even beyond his knowlege. You could call it warped honor, I am not sure, but it is respectable.&quot;** 

She looks back up, focusing her eyes on the interior lid of the coffin, just somewhere to look. **&quot;Of course, with him as my patron comes his servitor lich Rhaugilath. He is much kinder on principal, and equally as good a teacher, if not sometimes a bleeding heart.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;How did you meet Larloch~ What&#x27;s it like being his warlock~&quot;** *Ashden asked this rather out of the blue, a curious look in her eyes as she reached up to stroke Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s cheek. Her skin was so soft and smooth. Completely different from Ashden&#x27;s clammy dry skin.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I see.&quot;** She runs her fingers down her hair again, the question didn&#x27;t matter much, she just figured Ashen would like her asking questions about her. For a while she just lays in silence, unsure if anymore questioning was appropriate or if this was better. Her lack of social norms and cues was blaringly obvious to herself, but she imagined her perpetually calm face and façade as a whole hid most of that fact from Ashden.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hmmm~ Not really~ My family said we were cursed a long time ago so maybe it has something to do with that~ They never told me much about it though~ I&#x27;m not sure they even knew~&quot;** *She plays with a strand of her hair and just enjoys the feeling of Miz&#x27;ri petting her.* **&quot;I like to think I&#x27;m descended from heroes and that one of then was tricked or something, and that my light is just a little bit of there strength that survived on somehow, but honestly I don&#x27;t know~&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-18</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hmm.&quot;** She hums and returns to stroking her hair gently. Maybe some sort of poor reaction between the celestial plane and whatever made Greymourne? She didn&#x27;t know, could be interesting to look into, would be oddly amusing if it turned out to be some sort of mundane problem as well, rather than magical, even if such an outcome was improbable. **&quot;I see, do you know where it comes from?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">*Ashden was happy. Very happy. Snuggling close to Miz&#x27;ri was amazing, and when she lifts her face to look toward her it was like...like she wanted to look in her eyes. She liked that. She like that a lot.* **&quot;Hmmm...well...I&#x27;m actually an Aasimar~ I know I don&#x27;t seem like it but I have this...light inside me~ It comes out sometimes and makes me really shouty and stuff~ It&#x27;s really fun, but I get really sick afterwards~ I get that way any time I use powers like those~&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Probably the small enclosed space.&quot;** She runs her hand down her mop of hair once more. **&quot;But yes we can, I have no outstanding plans, and Larloch has yet to contact me, him or Rhaugilath.&quot;** She settles back into her spot, expecting they&#x27;d be here for quite some time, but there were worse fates surely than having an objectively cute woman kissing you and almost begging to show you affection. 

**&quot;Tell me something about yourself I don&#x27;t know.&quot;** She asks abruptly, her crimson eyes glancing down, her hand grasping her chin to make her look into them.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">*Ashden didn&#x27;t even think about it, knowing there was probably something in the crypt she could find to do. Some upkeep or tending, but honestly she knew it wasn&#x27;t anything imperative. Nothing that had to be done right that second. She would probably get to it later that day, but for right now...*

**&quot;Nothing solid~ Can we...stay here for a while longer~&quot;** *She felt Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s hand through her hair and nuzzled against her, holding her tight and just...feeling her. Feeling every little move she made. Even little shift. Every breath. Just...everything, and it was all wonderful. She was wonderful.* **&quot;You&#x27;re so warm~&quot;** *She says this with a soft, almost whisper as she lays there and soaks up every ounce of affection she can from their embrace, feeling like she was getting decades added onto her life just from the sheer tinder love she was feeling for Miz&#x27;ri.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">She wraps her other arm around her as well, holding her against herself as they just lay with each other in the darkness of the coffin. **&quot;Did you have plans for the day?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">**&quot;You slept no longer than I expected you to, and I was not bored.&quot;** She chooses not to elaborate further, and instead starts to gently pat and stroke her teal poofy hair, running her fingers through it as she goes.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Good morning~ I love you~&quot;** *She kisses her again, almost seeming like she needed to say again how she felt about Miz&#x27;ri, both for herself and the lady beside her to hear. No...she just liked saying and wanted to any chance she got.

It was such a small thing, the rising and falling of the other woman&#x27;s chest, but it felt nice...just listening to her breathing.

It was unique to Ashden to have such an intense desire to only press her lips to Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s. In the past people wished her for various sexual favors, but Ashden was content with this it seemed. It was strange, not bad per se, but unique as far as she was concerned. **&quot;Good morning.&quot;** She says rather formally between Ashden&#x27;s kisses.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">*A little time passes and eventually Ashden&#x27;s eyes flutter open, feeling the body of Miz&#x27;ri beside her, her head still on the other girl&#x27;s chest. She looked up and saw those crimson eyes staring at her in the dark, and Ashden&#x27;s smile faded into something like surprise. It was...it was a good sort though. She stared into those red orbs for a moment before leaning up and kissing the drow. She kissed her. And she kissed her some more. She eventually pulled away and just stared at her again. Stared into those eyes...and she went in for another kiss.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">*Ashden slept soundly beside Miz&#x27;ri, breathing easy, soft breaths and smiling. Even in her sleep she smiled. Her arms rested across the drow warlocks waist holding her close and her head against the other lady&#x27;s chest. Even in her sleep she could her the thumping of Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s heart, slow, calm, rhythmic, and it did nothing but help her sleep. There was something calming about it, life affirming, and that helped keep the nightmares away. The nightmares...could they even be called that, the horrid barrage of rages and sorrows brought on by her curses practically every night since she was old enough to remember? Even before she had gained Greymourn they would torment her, and after...well at least they could be shaped into something tangible, though whether that was better or worse was objective. She had just learned to accept them. To accept waking up screaming in the night for now reason. Crying about things she didn&#x27;t understand. Not sleeping for days on end just because it was pointless to try. It was fine...there was nothing for it...or so she told herself.*

**Babump Babump Babump**

*...But that sound...that simple thumping...for whatever reason focusing on it made the nightmares seem less...intrusive. Less noticeable. There was just that strong, simple sound that made Ashden feel safe and reminded her that she wasn&#x27;t alone. And she was able to sleep. It wasn&#x27;t perfect sleep, but it was better than any she had had in a long time.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">After the four hours for her trance ends, Miz&#x27;ri slowly starts to fade back into full consciousness. It was dark, but she could see; it was quiet as well, the only sound in the small space was the breathing of the crypt keeper and herself. She briefly wondered about the ventilation of the coffin, but pushed the question away until Ashden awoke. Speaking of her, with nothing better do, she watches her. Miz&#x27;ri knew, even with her limited understanding of social norms, that this was considered weird. But a lot of her was, wasn&#x27;t going to let it stop her now. Silently she watches her chest rise and fall rhythmically with each breath, she didn&#x27;t know why, but it was more than just a lack of anything else to do.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message">Fade to Black: Awwww they so sweet!!!!</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I know.&quot;** She pulls the coffin lid shut and closes her eyes, starting to slowly slip into her semi-conscious trance as the grave keeper snuggled up to her side.

Ashden felt good being around Miz&#x27;ri, maybe because they were similar in some ways, or because she was interesting, or even if only because she was cute.

It was easy to understand that&#x27;s what it meant to her, but to Miz&#x27;ri, all it was was the literal pressure of her lips on her skin. The act meant nothing, it wasn&#x27;t like she hadn&#x27;t kissed before, though it wasn&#x27;t for the same purposes really. She knew physical contact was enjoyed up here, and her attractiveness had suited her well in finding places to stay when she first emerged from the darkness and needed time for her eyes to adjust. Truthfully the sun still annoyed her, but that&#x27;s all it was now, an annoyance rather than searing pain. She wasn&#x27;t sure she&#x27;d have lived the first few months if she hadn&#x27;t used her body to secure places to live, places out of the light. She didn&#x27;t understand the point of this other than pleasure for her, but this wasn&#x27;t exactly pleasure as she understood it anyway. Clearly it did something for her, emotionally anyway from how this all sounded, but still, she&#x27;d payed more for less. **&quot;If that&#x27;s what it does for you, feel free then.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Ashden hears the question and smiles.* **&quot;Because I wanted to be close to you again~ That and I can&#x27;t kiss you yet~ I&#x27;m a bad kisser anyway~ Oh, I know~&quot;** *She lifts Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s hand to her lips and softly presses her lips against the back of her palm.

I&#x27;ve heard her name a few times from Larloch, from what I&#x27;ve heard she seems reasonable, for a demon lord.&quot;** She&#x27;s perplexed by all these odd micro rituals of bodily contact and what they were supposed to mean. Why did she touch their foreheads together, what did that accomplish, was it a gesture of their minds being close?  And her words were confusing as well, lonely with her, yet she was under the assumption Ashden wanted her around to not feel lonely. It could be a saying up here, and she could accept it was a cultural manner of speech she just wasn&#x27;t aware of. Slang and cultural norms and expectations rarely cropped up in research into curses, hexes, and necromancy. Larloch as well was generally unconcerned with the matters of the living, well, anything like this anyway, he was interested in what knowlege they had, especially adherents to Mystra. Her curiosity though, gets the better of her, and she figures if she reveals her lack of understanding it would be an opportunity for this Ashden to feel closer to her, she understands the concept people up here have over a romanticized idea of &quot;shared struggle&quot;. Of course it made no sense to her, all Drow suffered the same struggle of their society and the deadly games it made all who lived down there play, but it served to drive people apart. It was just one more oddity of surface dwellers. **&quot;But why did you touch our foreheads together?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Ashden nods happily, walking with Mis&#x27;ri while still holding her hand.

For someone so of death, she was rather touchy feely. She supposed the people up here enjoyed affection in such a manner, it didn&#x27;t make sense to her, what did physically closeness have to do with it, but she knew better than to question it. Despite having fled over a hundred years ago, she still had a lot to parse out in the ways of determining what of her time in The Underdark was worth remembering and keeping. **&quot;Myrkul willing, would you show me to such a person?&quot;** She figures mention of her patron would add a sense of personalness to the comment, a sign she at least payed attention to what the strange girl was talking about.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Ashden giggled at this and snapped her fingers, the coffin opening as she gives Miz&#x27;ri one more tight hug before pulling away from her and getting out of the coffin.

It&#x27;s an acceptable time to awake for you however, and I still need to eat, unfortunately.&quot;** She comments a little colder than she&#x27;d intended. It was hard at points to grasp the finer points of acting an emotion, or like she experienced them like the people of the surface. Sometimes it just wouldn&#x27;t come through at all, though it was rather paradoxical in the fact she cared more that the majority of her people as evident by her drastically changed outlook on life. Lolth spread a lot of lies of the surface, and her forced exile taught her to question everything she learned, cruelty and emotions alike. Of course, one doesn&#x27;t gain empathy in a day, and when  you live for hundreds of years, it may be just as long before her acclimation is truly complete. She presses her charcoal finger to squishy tip of Ashden&#x27;s nose again as a mean to hurry her along.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Ashden scrunches her nose to the boob, but not in a hard way, just in recognition.

It had been some time since she found herself in a world once more so cut off from the sun like The Underdark, one where it did not play a part in her day and cycles, it was almost refreshing. She spends the rest of her rest in idle thought, the idea of &quot;sleep&quot; never once cresting her elven mind, the concept was not only foreign, but one she considered dangerous. Though her trance offered her only darkness, it was a familiar and controlled darkness, dreams meant the unknown, and an unknown which may pit her against ideas she has no mind to face.

Once she&#x27;s fairly sure it&#x27;s an acceptable time for humans to wake up, she gently pokes Ashden&#x27;s very boopable nose. She knew that by most, if not every standard, she was cute, and that her nose was especially so, and it was easy to see. In an odd way thought, the idea of being attractive to her was detached from romance in any way. Selective breeding made noble drow attractive, but it wasn&#x27;t for romance and it wasn&#x27;t to attract mates, it was to lessen punishments on the surface if caught typically. It was weird to the people of the surface, but being attractive to her was no more than a note, and certainly didn&#x27;t have any away over her heavily muted emotions.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">What a strange situation she&#x27;d arrived in. Either way it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable by any means, much less her own, and the girl seemed happy enough, so it was an easy request to acquiesce to. Nonetheless she had to wonder how lonely she must be to need to seek this &quot;affection&quot; from those who did not know her, or perhaps there was a reason for such she was not aware of. If she played her cards right she&#x27;d learn over the coming days surely, she doubted the woman would ask her to leave anytime soon if her current clinginess was any indication.

*&quot;I wonder if this is what my friend sought in Eilistraee? Affection? Freedom?&quot;* The thought crosses her mind as soon as it leaves, and she doesn&#x27;t peruse it further, either it would one day be answered or not, and she&#x27;d become too jaded to that subject to care. Regardless, it was late, and if there was a time to trance it would be now. She closes her eyes, similar to sleep, but her mind doesn&#x27;t slow. As she can feel the familiar haze of a trance washes over her mind, the true darkness of her people&#x27;s sin is revealed once more, as it was every night. No memories, only the darkness to which they were banished to. She spends the next so many hours in this way, various thoughts floating through her mind as she remains acutely aware of the movements of the girl sleeping beside her.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Ashden smiles a big happy smile and snuggles back up, tucking the blanket around them both but clearly giving Miz&#x27;ri a bit more to make her as cozy as possible.

She&#x27;d never slept in a coffin before, but she liked tight and enclosed spaces, so this was up her alley to begin with. Of course she usually doesn&#x27;t share her bed with anyone, but this was going easy enough. She doesn&#x27;t know how, or if, she should feel about this, and so she doesn&#x27;t. There isn&#x27;t much to think about, another motion carried through for her own benefit.

Still if undeath was what she sought than she should take time to enjoy everything life had to offer first. It was clear she hadn&#x27;t been raised up in an environment where that was an option, or at least perceivably not. So she should enjoy it all now when she could! Eat ice cream, snuggle with cute people, play with puppies, all of it! Or whatever made her happy. Right now though, Ashden was very happy just having the sweet little cutie in her arms. It was very nice.* **&quot;You don&#x27;t have to stay if you don&#x27;t want to~ You&#x27;ve already done more than any stranger should expect~ Than a stranger deserves~&quot;** *She kisses her lightly on the head and loosens her grip enough to let Miz&#x27;ri escape if she desired to.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">Not only cursed and on the verge of undeath, this girl seemed abysmally lonely. Not to say she herself didn&#x27;t feel the cold claws of loneliness and obscurity clutch at her, the entire of drow society is about building yourself up around people who wish you weren&#x27;t there. No matter what friends or family you have down there, you may as well be by yourself, except being a lone would be safer than in company. Nonetheless though she doesn&#x27;t vocalize this, no real point to it. Though she was loosing sight of what the point of any of this was. She lets out a sigh before speaking again. **&quot;I&#x27;ve found that being around of enough of one or the other, and what lay in between, the differences are few at points, though at others quite stark. It&#x27;s hard to say whose better company, you could find life in either, whether similarities to the living or differences to the dead, maybe undeath is just the most preferable, sit on the edge of the coin rather than either side.&quot;** It wasn&#x27;t so much a belief of hers rather than idle musing at the prompt given by the bundle of cute depression in her arms, but nonetheless it was something she&#x27;d thought before. Undeath was stronger sure of course, but maybe it could offer companionship to either side that they would ignore otherwise. There was an odd security in an armor suited on nothing more than a set of bones, maybe more than that same armor being worn by flesh and blood. Though she knew her chances at finding good flesh and blood to fill out said armor were taken from her at birth. A trifle really, but something to consider other than her studies, duties, and future plans.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Not the living though~ That must be lonely~&quot;** *Ashden held her, and rubbed her back a bit, almost as if to comfort her for no reason. She had always felt closer to the dead than the living, even as a child. Her parents never did anything but whine and lament their cursed state and living situation, wealthy as they were. But Ashden wasn&#x27;t like them...she...was happy. Living on the border of death was all she had ever known so it never bothered her much, and the dead were good company for a girl who was too scary for other children to play with. It was hard sometimes when her curse caused her to break things and fall into comas for days on end, but for the most part she just enjoyed every second she could. After she met Greymourn and realized she could be a hero, well life just got even better!* **&quot;I like being alive~ It&#x27;s fun~ I like the dead to though~ They can be nice and usually just want a hug~ Sometimes though...sometimes I like feeling someone else breathing near me~ I like feeling their heart beating~ Hearing their voice when the talk~ It helps me remember...that I am alive~&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;If that&#x27;s how you feel, then I suppose.&quot;** Truthfully she didn&#x27;t know what she was on about. The dead were a valuable resource, not just in Drow necromantic rituals to advance further and to use as undying soldiers in the endless march to conquer other houses, but as an art of magic all it&#x27;s own. House T&#x27;sarran were quite inured to undeath and Larloch was as well, obviously.  Nonetheless, it didn&#x27;t matter about either of their views, the dead outnumber the living, it was easy to have more than one way and allow them both to remain faithful to their own. 

**&quot;Larloch does not view it as such, but I suppose in my own way I am typically surrounded by the dead myself as well.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Ashden puts her own arms around Miz&#x27;ri, holding her close and just enjoying the feeling of her there.

Miz&#x27;it would be able to hear the faintest thumping of Ashden&#x27;s heart, slow and at times hardly audible, but there. It was a quiet, rhythmic sound like a drum inside a cave, so close yet so distant. Ashden pulled the cover over them both and just curled up next to the drow, speaking with a quiet, gentle tone as she answered.* **&quot;My bone dad is Myrkul, but I do all this just because I enjoy it~ Because the dead are so easy to forget~ Everyone is scared of being forgotten~ So, if I remember them and show them love, then they can rest easy~ They can have peace~ And that&#x27;s important, right~&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">Miz&#x27;ri runs a dark thumb over Ashden&#x27;s hand, a course of emerald streaking through and briefly giving off a dull light.

She reached over and noodled her finger with Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s and hummed a little until a question was posed to which she nodded happily.* **&quot;Yeah, it helps me feel what they feel so I can take better care of them~ They and it&#x27;s warm in its own way~ I don&#x27;t want to die or anything, I just...feel comfy with the dead~&quot;** *She pulls away and lays down on her side, still holding Miz&#x27;ri&#x27;s hand and smiling a bit, having removed her armor to change into a simple long dress of blue cotton. It was warm to the touch and extremely soft, though it looked a little funny on Ashden&#x27;s skinny form.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;You act like I&#x27;ve never been buried alive before.&quot;** She chuckles as she steps into the coffin with a little less apprehension than was healthy for the situation. Though being as the two were, the concept of healthy meant very little.

She situates herself in her small spot as she feels the other woman lay her head on her shoulder, only to look over with a raised brow. Was this what this was supposed to be. No sex, just the two pressed up against each other? It was less effort surely, but she failed to see what the other woman got out of this if she wasn&#x27;t getting off to this. She would allowed to riffle through her menagerie of cursed objects and this was all she wanted in return? It seemed to simple, yet there was no assassin over her shoulder, blade dipped in poison ready to make her pay with death, so she didn&#x27;t know how to proceed. But one does not maneuver the treachery of Drow politics by being anything less than a smooth operator, and though on the inside she was cold and calculating, not truly understanding emotions others than hatred and jealousy as her people taught her, she could act the part. **&quot;But this is a lovely coffin, and you are quite soft, a welcome and easy presence to be around. I suppose I could be crammed in a grave with much worse. Though tell me, Ashden, do you oft sleep where they dead lay?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Silly lady~ You don&#x27;t have to be naked to cuddle~&quot;** *She pats her head and then goes over to the sarcophagus, clapping twice as the lid slides over a bit to reveal another coffin inside which does the same, revealing a cushioned interior. She puts in the pillows and then holds out her hand to Miz&#x27;ri to help her inside.* **&quot;Don&#x27;t worry, we&#x27;ll leave the lid open since it&#x27;s your first time~&quot;** *She sits down in the coffin beside the drow, just being beside her for a second...until she leans over and softly puts her head on the other warlock&#x27;s shoulder.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Definitely cursed.&quot;** The Drow woman points her hand forward, the green outer ring of her curse spells spinning into place as the lines draw themselves within the rune lines boundary. Her spell ends and the circle fades, a bolt of emerald shooting up through the crystal chained to her palm and up her sleeve. 

She looks back to Ashden and notes the pillows and blanket. She&#x27;s slept in better, she&#x27;d slept in worse, being an exile taught one a degree of humility she found, in one way or another. **&quot;I will not be removing my garments for this, I hope you understand.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That&#x27;s Wilbur~ He&#x27;s a naughty boy~&quot;** *Ashden whispers as she sits next to Miz&#x27;ri, a smile on her face, a blanket over her shoulders, and a pair of pillows against her chest.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*As she tries to understand the skull before her she sees the weave...convulse. It is as if the skull both does and doesn&#x27;t exist, the very spell itself seeming to desperately want to ignore that it is real, but Miz&#x27;ri does begin to understand what she is looking at and why magic seems to want to deny it. Within this skull is the ability to &quot;undo&quot;, or make that which is as if it had never been, but at a terrible cost. This...is a Ruinstone, and its very presence is unnatural and wrong.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Angelkin Weeb#7597</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">Miz&#x27;ri takes notice of the skull first, her crimson eyes drawn to what was closest to familiar. She approaches the object and crouches down in front of it, the leather of her boots creaking lightly at the movement. She knows better than to touch obviously cursed things unless she knew how to end send curse and what said curse did. She knew neither and so would be content to observe from afar. As the pale woman of the grave searches for her blanket she reaches to her side, to the chained drab and beaten dull green and gold book at her hip and takes it into her hand. She turns her book of shadows to the right pages and starts to hold her focus over the book as she chants in a low tone, drawing out the ritualistic arcane energies. A green spell circle outfit with many crossing and intersecting lines, all in confusing patterns none but her and her patron would understand, the effect of years of arcane genius and madness. Soon the threads of the weave lay plane before her, and she looks over the skill once more, seeing in what way the weave was woven through the object, and by what magic it was stitched in with.</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-07-10</p> <p class="message">*Ashden walks into her room in the crypt with Miz&#x27;ri in hand, the small bedroom containing a small bed, many lanterns, shovels, and stuffed animals. She hums a little as she walks over to a wall and presses a button, an illusionary door vanishing to reveal another chamber in which was a large sarcophagus surrounded by candelabras and a few rather spooky looking artifacts.* **&quot;Here we go~ This is my secret no-no room where I keep all my cursed junk~ Feel free to look around while I grab a blanket~&quot;** *Ashden goes into her room for a few things and leaves Miz&#x27;ri to poke around. Amongst the more notable items are a skull with a jewel in the forehead from which many runes in deep speech stretch across, carved into the bone, a staff made seemingly from fossilized wood, a large book with celestial and infernal rules both intertwined in an unnatural fashion, and a black orb with a single sapphire &quot;eye&quot; in its center.*</p></li>
