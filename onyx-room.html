A few other details to be noted is a thigh garter belt that held two daggers and a black pendant that hung around her neck.Her Hair was tied back into a messy ponytail and her face done up with some black eyeshadow and purple lipstick. The black hooded cloak she seemed to always wear was down and the front open to show off the outfit. She flatten out her clothes from the wrinkles of being folded before heading on out to see what she could find</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#1abc9c">xKillJ0y#4703</p><p class="time">2021-06-20</p> <p class="message">*Onyx stopped in front of the door that was presumably her room, she took a moment to open the door slowly scoping out the room before locking the door behind her. She sat down on the bed and began to unpack the very few things and changed out of her armor and into her common clothes*</p></li>
