He thought it would be fine, just dating a few girls for fun and not committing to anything, but now he was sitting here with one as they spilled their hearts out to each other while the other was...well he didn&#x27;t know.

It wasn&#x27;t a trap left by the village or by anything else...the ground just opened up and I feel in.&quot;** *She pointed at her left eye* **&quot;There was a massive gem there.  That was calling for me...after touching it the voice went slient and a piece broke off, entering into my eye.  While I was out for a few minutes...I heard just a loud blaring over the village.  Running back...it was just all burned.  Then...I saw my daughter.  She was what..about 15?  Fighting the monsters off.&quot;** *She rubbed her head* **&quot;If I was a second sooner....I could&#x27;ve saved her....one of the monsters was made of pure metal.

Very surprised.* **&quot;You...have a daughter?&quot;** *It wasn&#x27;t that huge of a surprise he supposed, but all the same he hadn&#x27;t heard about that until now, and given she wasn&#x27;t here with Firsa he supposed things might be...complicated.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-07-19</p> <p class="message">*She looked over to seeing CL choke over all the licks and giggle.

Big ones being with Wave and the Rui?  If I am correct.  I for one don&#x27;t care for it...I can&#x27;t join that though.

What I mean is, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking for in a relationship, or if I even am.

CL was used to being faster then most but...* **BANG** *The wind was taken out of him as he began to face Arthain face to face.  He tried his hardest to flap away* **&quot;OI!  FIRSA HELP!&quot;**

*Firsa just choose to ignore him* **&quot;That will keep him busy for quiet a bit.  He will be fine.&quot;** *She waved a hand*

He wasn&#x27;t sure how exactly to respond at first, but just figured it best to be direct?* **&quot;Nothing to be sorry for though. We&#x27;re friends right? Friends...go to friends...for hugs and stuff.&quot;** *That sounded right. Yeah that sounded right.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-07-17</p> <p class="message">*Firsa just wanted a hug as she began to slowly drop the elf back to the groud and sat down somewhere* **&quot;Yeah...yeah.&quot;** *She pulled her hair back as she gave a nod* **&quot;So...sorry to have barged in.

He could sense she was having a hard time though and honestly...well she gave really good hugs. He wrapped his arms around her and hugged her back, holding her close and just trying to share his warmth with her.* **&quot;It&#x27;s...okay. I know my mom and dad care about me so...that&#x27;s more than I can ask for. I uh...care about you too...ya know?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-07-16</p> <p class="message">*She heard him speak as she turned and began to nod to him* **&quot;I am sorry about your dad.&quot;** *She began to straighten herself up as she kept on listening.  The Dwarf may be quiet but she knew when to talk and when not to talk.  Now she tossed away the hammer as she walked up to the taller man and gave the half-elf a hug.  Her strong muscles lifting up Zephyr and holding him there* **&quot;I am sorry to do this to you...but I just wanted a hug and your story is sadder then anything I have heard.  Maybe one day you can find your mom again.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-07-15</p> <p class="message">*Zephyr looked toward her and realized this was something heavy, taking a seat across from her and seeming lost in thought for a moment before answering slowly.* **&quot;After my...dad died, my mom took me way up north to train me. Taught me how to defend myself using sword and spell, but then...&quot;** *He hesitated, not sure how to word the next part exactly, so he didn&#x27;t sugar coat it.* **&quot;She left me. She was afraid me being around her would just cause me more pain, so once she felt I was ready she...just disappeared. After that I didn&#x27;t know what to do. How to live. So I just wandered around for a long time, eventually got into writing and scribe work, but also using magic to make money. Even then I didn&#x27;t know who I wanted to be or what I wanted to do for a long time. Somedays I&#x27;m still not sure...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-07-15</p> <p class="message">*Firsa had been giving a nod as she shook her head* **&quot;I can&#x27;t heal...axe from Mav cut it all over.  Couldn&#x27;t even heal...need to rest.&quot;** *Her tone was heavy and hard as she began to relax*

**&quot;Sorry...for coming here Zephyr.  Just I needed someone I trust to go to.  I been feeling...lost around the guild as of late.&quot;** *She put her hammer on the ground.

Oh....* **&quot;Oh uh...I see. Do you need healing or...maybe a chair...uh...&quot;** *Zephyr seemed concerned, but also nervous, but mostly concerned. He offered her a place to sit but seemed a little more awkward than usual.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-07-14</p> <p class="message">*She gave a nod as she began to step in and take in a deep breath.* **”Sorry to have bother you.

*Zephyr snorted as he was roused from his sleep, not even remembering going to bed. Oh right, he laid down to rest his eyes for a second...several hours ago. He really needed to get an actual sleep schedule worked out. He groaned a bit, stretched, and made sure he looked decent in his comfy pants and fitted shirt before walking toward the door, his hair a total mess but what else was new. He opened it and was surprised to see Firsa standing there, more than a little beat up and looking sort of determined maybe?* **&quot;Oh hey Firsa...uh...come in?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-07-14</p> <p class="message">**Enter Firsa**

**KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK**

*There was a loud knocking on the door as Firsa began to wait on the outside...she was covered in slash marks from her duel with Mavmir and began to wonder what was going to happen.  Would she finally get her chance...will she fail...who knows but she did know it was enough to try and play nice she wanted a chat.* **&quot;Zephyr you here?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2021-07-14</p> <p class="message"><blockquote>

He hears a knock at his door and furrows his brown curiously, not sure who would be looking for him at such an hour. He stands up and walks to the door, but when he opens it his eyes go wide. Standing there is a dark figure whose features are ever so slightly...like his own.* **&quot;Uncle Darius?&quot;** *Darius smiles a bit and looks at Zephyr with a mix of sadness and relief, the would be play wright more than a little taken aback.* **&quot;Hello Zephyr...it&#x27;s been a while.&quot;** *Zephyr is still in shock as he tries to process this. He hadn&#x27;t seen Darius in...years. He had popped up from time to time, both while growing up and even after...after his father&#x27;s death. Though Darius and his mother never quite got along after that day, Zephyr thought because she blamed him for not getting there in time to help. Zephyr...didn&#x27;t feel that way. Darius and his dad were brothers after all...and he didn&#x27;t want to believe either would abandon the other. He truly didn&#x27;t...yet....* **&quot;BARK BARK!&quot;** *Arty suddenly ran out the door and started rubbing his head happily against Darius&#x27; leg, the fellow looking down in shock before crouching to pet the little familiar. Seeing this, all of Zephyr&#x27;s concerns vanished...and he just smiled.* **&quot;Sorry Zeph...I...I know it&#x27;s been a long time since I last visited but...&quot;** *Zephyr pulled his uncle up and hugged him, the other man letting out a sigh as he reciprocated, less for himself and more for his nephew&#x27;s sake.* **&quot;It&#x27;s alright Uncle Darius. It&#x27;s good to see you.&quot;** *Darius felt like crying...but held it back, pulling away and speaking with a slight quiver in his voice.* **&quot;Zeph...we need to talk. There&#x27;s something...something you need to know.&quot;** *Zephyr tilted his head, stepping aside to let Darius in.* **&quot;What is it?&quot;** 

*Darius hesitated but then finally...* **&quot;Zephyr...you have a cousin...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-27</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message">*Zephyr suddenly shoots up in bad, his mother&#x27;s screams of mixed rage and anguish while the image of his father&#x27;s stone face shattering as it hit the ground were all still whirling in his mind. It was there to...that horrible laughing maw with its single massive eye looking toward him, full of a twisted sort of spite and pleasure. Zephyr could feel a tightness in his chest, his hand gripping his blanket as sweat poured from his body.*

*But it wasn&#x27;t fear he felt in that moment.*

*All he felt...*

*Was rage.*

**&quot;Wan...&quot;**

*Zephyr heard the noise and looked over to see Arty laying beside him, staring up at him with concerned eyes. Seeing his childhood friend there helped him more than he could have imagined, the tension he felt slowly fading even as the blue glow in his eyes subsided. He let out a breath and brought a hand to his face, letting the tension and anger pass. He hated feeling that way...but it was there inside of him.*

*It was always there...*

**&quot;I&#x27;m alright Arty...just a bad dream. A bad memory...&quot;** *He reached over and gave the hound spirit a rub on the head which it happily accepted. He then got up and decided to find a book to read, hoping to clear his head. There probably wouldn&#x27;t be anymore sleep for him that night...but that was alright. That was easier...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-05-29</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-05-12</p> <p class="message">*He was rusty but still remembered the chords.

He looked down at what he had been working on and found it slightly drooled upon. Well...at least it wasn&#x27;t a spell scroll.
