Kessan will never resent you for things you might do but you also already know what others expect from you. Just have patience when you make a decision.

I still need a command word from him to ignite the blade and the flow of the flame will come in time. I am pretty sure that the weapon will be of historyc relevance once he returns to his homeland.&quot;** *Kessan explains.* **&quot;The metalwork is the least of my concernes to be honest... But that aside, what I want to archieve is a blade that doesn&#x27;t let Vian down when he needs it. The enchantment needs to be stable, powerfull, self refreshing so it doesn&#x27;t run out and not be influenced by his innate electrical nature. I noticed by just being around him, fighting with and against him, that unlike us, his elemental energy we harness from our draconic ancestry and exhale it as a breath. He channels it through his whole body without exhaling it and that might interfere with the enchantment cohesion. Especialy if we regard the fact that he needs to attune to the blade. There are a lot of factors that will be needed to be taken into account without me adding big, unwieldy compensator parts to the weapon. Thats pretty much why I need your help Rhogar.&quot;** 

*Firefeather in the meantime stirs her tea a little and just intertwines her tail with Rhogars and just listens. She had no real Idea what Kessan was on about.* **&quot;Whys nots justs makes blades outs ofs fires?&quot;** *She asks, looking at Kessan before she just summons a scimitar shaped flame in her free hand.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2021-03-04</p> <p class="message">Rhogar smiles back. Of course he knew how much honey she liked in her tea but it was endearing that they were at a level where she knew he knew. He adds the honey and returns the drizzler to the pot while he listens to Kessan half-heartedly as he trie to soak in this brief moment of connection with Firefeather. As Kessan takes a sip he realizes the time has run out and now has to reply, **&quot;Enchantment can be quite the personal undertaking, that is true. Though for a warrior like Vian I feel that the metalwork may be of more sentimental value to him. Were you hoping to also personalize the enchantment of the flame? I must confess I do not know him very well. What are you hoping to accomplish?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#f1c40f">Anoth#1924</p><p class="time">2021-03-04</p> <p class="message">*Firefeather just holds out her cup and smiles at Rhogar as if she just trusted him with what will be the right ammount.

Meanwhile, Kessan picks up one of the lemons and drizzles some of the fruits juice into his tea.* **&quot;Regardless, I am glad you two found the time to come by. It&#x27;s not like I can&#x27;t make the blade on my own but I&#x27;d like to make it elegant and fitting for Vian. Enchanting a weapon is easily enough but making it elegant and fitting to a specific person is a different beast all together.&quot;** *Kessan says before he takes a sip of his tea.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#c2f759">Pender#7279</p><p class="time">2021-03-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Of course, which is why I thwarted the idea of an experiment.&quot;** then replying to Firefeather as he adds some honey to his tea **&quot;Right my dear, I have no qualms with it.

Firefeather was in the meantime pondering. The S at the end of her words was wrong, she knew that but she had no idea herself why she did it...

Firefeather blinked a little and started poking at her forked tongue. She doubted as well that this was the cause of her weird common but the she just shrugged and followed the silver dragonborn inside. This place was huge!
