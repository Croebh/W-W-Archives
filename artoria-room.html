I&#x27;m sure it will work out. Come on.&quot;** *Artoria took Arana&#x27;s hand and headed out, giving Chad a few pats before locking the door behind her.*

**&quot;We can go once you are ready.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-06</p> <p class="message">**&quot;You still look cute ya know.&quot;** *She said playfully as she walked over to help Arana tame her hair a bit.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-06</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hm... I think this will do.&quot;**
*Arana grabs a some short and a plain T-Shirt, as well as a belt. She quickly disappears into the bathroom and closes the door. It takes her moment to switch into her new set of clothes. No need for make up today, but the halfling still wants to get her hair in order before leaving.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-06</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh sure! lets me see...&quot;** *She looks around and lays out a few choices for her including a sundress, some shorts, skirts, simple T-Shirts and the like. Plenty of choices for comfy casual attire.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I noticed, sometimes a not-so-evil side comes through. He still has a long way to go, though. Anyway, can I borrow clothes from you again? Doesn&#x27;t have to be anything fancy. Just don&#x27;t like crossing the hallway in nothing but my night shirt during the day.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;You&#x27;re probably right. I do see some light shining through though which makes me really happy.&quot;** *She reaches over and pets the penglich, smiling softly toward him as she does.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well, this whole situation must be extremely demeaning for him, but I get what you mean. I guess the best we can do is ask him once we wakes up and give him time to think about it. He will probably say no at first and the only reason why he might play along is because he thinks it can help him escape. Still, I think letting him explore the guild could help with his redemption.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hmmm, I never thought about that. A harness would be great for him! Though it might be a bit too demeaning. Hmmm.&quot;** *She pondered this for a moment, not seeming against the idea herself but not sure how Chad would feel about it. It would be more easy to take him out but, well, he wasn&#x27;t a pet or a child ~~even if he acted like the later sometimes.~~*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Yeah, I guess you are right. Hm... is that how you carry him around? Seems a little restrictive. Can&#x27;t you get him like... a harness? So he can walk around a bit? I know we can&#x27;t let him run around freely, but I also can&#x27;t think of a better way of doing it.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-05</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hmm, well I doubt he&#x27;d want to come along, what it being a temple and all.&quot;** *She gives him a gentle pet as he sleeps.* **&quot;He should be fine here probably. Or I guess I could let him ride in my lantern again.&quot;** *She picks up the ornate looking lantern, sized for her, from her nightstand, the flame within a beautiful many colored sort that looks more like a sparkler at times than a flame.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-04</p> <p class="message">*Artoria&#x27;s excitement turned out to be the ideal distraction.*
**&quot;You mean, right now? Well, I need to get dressed first and we should grab at least a snack in the guild hall. I sometimes accidentally skip meals, even though I really shouldn&#x27;t. What will we do about Chad?**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Okay! We can head that way whenever you&#x27;e ready!&quot;** *She was ready to hop out of bed and get dressed but then stopped, leaning in to give Arana a kiss on the forehead. She then got out of bed and went to put on some more casual clothes and getting ready to head out when her sis was ready.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-04</p> <p class="message">*Suddenly the halfling was very nervous. It takes a lot to unsettle here. However, a potential solution to the biggest problem in her life and the chance that it could be taken from her would do it.*
**&quot;Ok. Let&#x27;s do that.&quot;** *is all she can get out.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Hmmm I think it could work. We&#x27;ll go over to the temple in a bit and see about getting some help. I&#x27;m sure someone there will know what move we should take.&quot;** *She smiled, seeming confident about this path. It did sound a bit more appealing, though she wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work out or not. She hoped it would though!*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;You think that&#x27;s possible? It does sound much better than the other 2 options I have right now. Well, I would certainly need help with that, since no one ever seemed to listen to my prayers... no matter how much I tried. Maybe I&#x27;m just cursed or something, I have no idea.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-04</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Oh no, I understand. Honestly it&#x27;s a big decision. I mean, it&#x27;s scary too. I would offer you an alternative but I don&#x27;t know of one that would leave you any better off. Except maybe a celestial...I know we have a ton of clerics and stuff here at the guild so maybe one of their patrons could help you out.&quot;** *Artoria thought about that for a second, remembering Arrius and Rosa who were both quite close to Bahamut, Tharnam, Asital, Zirr, Exia, and a few others all had patrons to that they spoke with on occasion. Maybe one of them could provide an alternative she was more comfortable with.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I mean, I know that practice is important. Maybe after I make that pact with Maretta... if I end up doing that.&quot;**
*She let&#x27;s out a deep sigh.*
**&quot;You would think I would jump at this opportunity, but isn&#x27;t that easy.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-03</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I understand completely. Even if your magic wasn&#x27;t what it is, fighting in the arena can be...an experience.&quot;** *Artoria still remember the number of times she had been beaten up, knocked down, thrown around, zapped, slapped, clapped, nearly eaten...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-03</p> <p class="message">*Arana giggles a little when the gnome strokes her hair. Usually she didn&#x27;t like when other people touched her, but she doesn&#x27;t mind when her sister does it.*
**&quot;I see. Don&#x27;t think that stuff is for me, at least with my current pact. The side effects aren&#x27;t worth it to use my magic without a very good reason.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Not at the moment. Might go do a duel in the arena, or at least sign up for one. Been meaning to practice more.&quot;** *She reached over and stroked Arana&#x27;s hair a bit, not sure how normal that was but knowing how much she herself like it when people did that to her and hoping her sis would enjoy it to. She had seemed to so far anyway.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-02</p> <p class="message">*The halfing giggles before rolling back on her side to have a better look Artoria.*
**&quot;Thanks sis, this really means a lot to me. I will add it to the list of things I need to work on. Got any plans for today, other than that walk you promised Chad?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well, you&#x27;re not worthless, at least I don&#x27;t believe that for what it&#x27;s worth. Other than that feelings like those take time to overcome, and people who help uplift you.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-02</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I see, thanks for telling me. It makes a lot of sense. I&#x27;m also used to people seeing me as... how to put this... lesser? Worthless?. That might be where these feelings are coming from. Not sure what to do about that.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-01</p> <p class="message">*Artoria thinks for a second and then nods a bit.* **&quot;I used to, back when I was really young. I...I tried to earn the respect of my superior officers in Ganol&#x27;s armies, but I was rarely ever good enough to do that. After all I was an expendable soldier without much talent. So eventuallyi gave up even trying and just focused on survival. Even when Durbin, the man who gave me my freedom, tried to encourage me it never really stuck. Then after I had my freedom and eventually started being myself...I guess that feeling of being good enough didn&#x27;t matter anymore. Now I&#x27;m just happy with doing my best. Although there was a short time when leanring to use my powers and loosing in the arena that I got down, but I eventually figured out that being good enough didn&#x27;t matter. All that mattered was me trying my best, so that&#x27;s what I try and do! I won&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t still get discouraged sometimes, but it rarely lingers for long before I start trying again!&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-01</p> <p class="message">**&quot;That would be nice, but...&quot;**
*She pauses for a moment as she is trying to find the right words.*
**&quot;...do you ever feel like no matter what or how much you are doing, it&#x27;s never good enough?&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-05-01</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Well hopfully you want have to do that anymore!&quot;** *Says the adventurer who gets knocked out all the time.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-05-01</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I guess that&#x27;s true and I&#x27;m working on that.

Honestly you have a lot of down time around here.&quot;** *She looks out the window at the day outside, looking like it might rain.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-04-30</p> <p class="message">**&quot;I think we should let him dream a bit longer about world domination... or whatever might be going through his fluffy little head.&quot;**
*Arana rolls on her back and stretches herself. While looking a the ceiling she says:*
**&quot;I think I will take another day off. Yesterday was just so eventful. Besides, I need to think about a few things.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-04-30</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Good.&quot;** *She smiles and then looks down at Chad, petting him lightly.* **&quot;Yeah, he&#x27;s a sweetie, he just needs reminding.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-04-30</p> <p class="message">*The halfling nods before saying:* 
**&quot;I don&#x27;t I think ever slept better. Thanks again.&quot;**
*She keeps her voice down to not wake up the sleepy penguin.*
**&quot;I&#x27;m glad that this little troublemaker hasn&#x27;t gone elsewhere.&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-04-30</p> <p class="message">*Chad was softly snoozing with a* **E-E-E-Evil...E-E-E-Evil....”**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-04-30</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Morning!&quot;** *She said with a smile, slowly rising up out of bed.* **&quot;Sleep well?&quot;** *She stretched a bit and then patted Chad a bit.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-04-29</p> <p class="message">*After a very long and relaxing sleep Arana wakes. This was rather usual for her, she rarely felt this way after waking up. Seems like Artoria&#x27;s support from last night as well sleeping in the same bed did wonders for her.*
**&quot;Good morning...?&quot;** *She asks carefully, to see if she was up already and not wanting to wake her sister up if she wasn&#x27;t.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-04-26</p> <p class="message">*In a peaceful nights like, Arana has a very sound sleeper. Seemingly she was also very protective, as she held the walrus plushy tight for the entire night. The halfling would sleep for a while longer. When Artoria presses her forehead against hers, Arana smiles in her sleep and leans into it.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2021-04-26</p> <p class="message">*Artoria dreamed of simple things, like cake, dresses, and stuffed animals. Her dreams were always so pleasant, given her past, but having a friend next to her helped keep her mind at ease. She snuggled against Arana and let out little squeaks as she slept, smiling lightly in her sleep until morning came. As the light creeped in she would slowly wake up, finding herself holding both Chad and Arana, the penguin gently pressed between them with Captain Squish-Tusk there as well. She looked up at Arana and smiled before pulling Chad close and pressing her forehead against the other girl&#x27;s.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-04-25</p> <p class="message">*While Arana is sleeping some very unusual happens. She has a dream, but one that isn&#x27;t a nightmare. In fact is was a very pleasant one. This almost never happened to her.*
*In her dream she was walking through seemingly endless fields. The sun was shinning and there was a mild breeze. After a while she walked up to a tree on a hill. In its shadow she sat down and enjoyed the wind until the dream ended.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#0">Boddy#5298</p><p class="time">2021-04-17</p> <p class="message">**&quot;Good night sis...&quot;**

Once she was back in the main room, she grabs Captain Squish-Tusk, before heading for the bed. She lies down, covers herself with the blanket and hugs the walrus.*
**&quot;This isn&#x27;t so bad...&quot; ** *she mumbles to herself.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2021-04-17</p> <p class="message">*He began to try and flip his wings* **&quot;Well!

She leaned down and picked him up, giving him a squeeze before heading over to her bed.

It had been a pretty intense quest, more than she had expected it to be. Still, she was happy that she and her allies had come out of it mostly unscathed, though she was concerned about Wave. She hoped the healers could figure out how to heal their voice soon, and that the laughing fit hadn&#x27;t caused any permenant damage. She tried not to worry and fell onto her bed, looking up at the cieling while trying to relax. After that she started thinking of how to spend the money she had earned. Maybe some new armor or other form of protection? That could help! She had also started thinking of new ways to use her magic, already excited about some of the ideas she had been having.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">*Rui smiles as she is being lead on.

And she had...she had seen past them hadn&#x27;t she. She had seen herself beyond those scars...that she was more than them. And now seeing them gone, even if only a few...she knew she was finally free of them. Not just because Rui had taken them away, but because...she could finally see past them.

NOT GIRLFRIEND!...not yet.  I mean...you have to show her what love means.  Not just sex.  Just giving and taking in a relationship is what makes Rui, Chloe, and Camille closer.  So FOCUS!&quot;*
**&quot;Okay...&quot;** *As she snaps back to reality* **&quot;I can help you.  The way I see it is this...not every single thing about love is just sex or kissing.  Just being there like this.&quot;** *She takes her hand and points to her own heart then to Art&#x27;s* **&quot;You have a heart to heart with someone.  That is love.  I am just cute.  And you are cute as well.  I don&#x27;t like this Drubin..they are a bitch.  But I will always be here for you okay?

Squeezes her tight. She was confused. Really confused. The feelings inside her were all over the place and she didn&#x27;t know what she wanted, or what she wanted them to be. She...she really liked Rui! Rui understood her, as did many others. But with Rui there was something else there. Love? Lust? Something she couldn&#x27;t define yet? Maybe it was none of that or all of that. All she knew though...what she felt most...was safety in her arms. Kindness. Love, but she wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of love. She didn&#x27;t think it was romantic love, even though Rui was really attractive. But it WAS love, and she wanted to feel more of it, and that confused her. All she knew...was she wanted to keep hugging Rui...and feeling her warmth.*

**&quot;I&#x27;m sorry...I don&#x27;t know what this is...I don&#x27;t know how to even express it. But I feel something Rui, and I just wanted to...I want to express it, but I don&#x27;t know how. Sex seemed like the easiest way to, and you&#x27;re so beautiful, but I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s what this is. I&#x27;m just...you don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hideous to look at, even naked you look at me and see me, not this scarred body. If Drubin would...even he would look away sometimes when we were together. But you never do. You never have. I...I like that feeling. The feeling I get when you look at me and see just...me...&quot;** *She presses her head against Rui&#x27;s chest and is still crying, but smiles an honest sort of smile. She doesn&#x27;t understand these feelings at all, but she wants to hold onto them...even if she still can&#x27;t express them right.* **&quot;And I...&quot;** *She rubs a hand across Rui&#x27;s arm, along the other girl&#x27;s scars.* **&quot;I want to make you feel the same. The way you make me feel. Like you aren&#x27;t your scars. Does any of this make sense to you? What is it? How do I express it if not through sex or kissing of whatever? What am I doing? Rui...help...&quot;**</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#2162a3">Emonster002#4375</p><p class="time">2020-07-17</p> <p class="message">*Rui stops the buttons being undone* **&quot;Artoria.

She was...so warm. So soft. So kind. She heard the words and felt something inside cry out. Something she couldn&#x27;t remember feeling. She knew what simple physical desire was, but didn&#x27;t know enough about love to be sure if that was it. All she knew was feeling Rui there behind her, holding her, being tender toward her in a way so few others in her life ever had...she knew she wanted. Wrong or not she knew. Scared as she was of what might happen...she couldn&#x27;t stand not at least knowing. At least once. Chloe...Camille...I&#x27;m sorry. Please understand that just this once I...I...*

**&quot;Rui...I&#x27;m really sorry...&quot;**

*Artoria stepped away and turned around to look at Rui, hesitation and want both clear in equal parts, but in the end the latter one out. She reached up and undid the first button of the white dress, then the second, and the third...*

Something she both knew and didn&#x27;t know...and she was scared to let it out. Scared of what would happen. She she didn&#x27;t. She choked it down and it HURT, but it was better this way. Safer...for both of them.*

Artoria walks inside and goes through a few dresses on her clothes rack, not sure if she had anything that would fit Rui but knowing she could figure out something that would. Because of her...unusual figure, Artoria often had a hard time finding clothes that would work for her. So she ended up with a wide variety of lengths and sizes.

She was wearing a simple white dress, nothing fancy and rather plain aside from the thin blue ribbon tied around her lower chest to keep it conformed to her figure just a little. On her feet were a pair of ankle strap shoes, again nothing fancy, and she had her hair held out of her eyes by a small blue hair clip. She looked herself over and smiled some more, doing  a little spin and finding herself giggling a bit. She could do some basic makeup on her own now thanks to Rui&#x27;s guidance and Hyacinth&#x27;s advice, though she still mostly focused just on a light applications of eye liner, blush, and light pink lipstick. Even so...she felt beautiful. Just that feeling was enough to make her forget everything, even if only for a bit, and feel like...herself. The her she wanted to be. The her she always had been on the inside but had never had a chance to be until now. She let out a sigh and frowned lightly, knowing she would have to clean up and head out to do some chores soon around the guild, preparing to walk over to her bathroom...but stopping.*

*She held a hand to her chest, thinking for a moment before looking toward her room door. The whole world was out there, an unforgiving, unkind world full of people just waiting to ridicule and bring her down. Or at least...that was what the negative voices would always say. What her fears would say...but...but out there were her guildmates to. Her friends. Asital, Storm, Hyacinth, Rui, Xarakas, and many, MANY more! She looked down at herself, then at the door, then at her self again and felt a tear form in the corner of her eyes from stress. But She steeled herself, wiped it away gently, and without giving herself time to talk herself out of it...she walked over to the door, opened it, and walked out into the world...as herself.*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-07-16</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-07</p> <p class="message">*Explosions around her.

*Artoria&#x27;s eyes shot open, her chest heaving and her sheets soaked in sweat. Her expression is wide eyed as she tries to remember where she is, or if she&#x27;s still in combat! But slowly, as she feels the sun&#x27;s warmth washing over her through the window she starts to remember. Her breathing steadies, her muscles loosen, and her heart slows.* **&quot;Just a dream. Just a dream.&quot;** *She tells herself over and over again before flipping to her side. She opens her eyes to see a stuffed plush of a walrus with a funny captains hat, corncob pipe, and eye patch staring back at her. She smiles wearily and manages a light giggle. Captain Squish-Tusk, always there when she needed him most. She pulls the stuffed walrus closer to her, it being easily as big as she was, and wrapped her arms and legs around it, pulling it tight against her and burying her face into it. It was so stupid to need something like this beside her just to sleep at night, or so the toxic part of her said, but as felt herself calming down the rest of her knew how important it was to let herself have it. To let herself be stupid...to vulnerable...*</p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#000000">Avrae#6944</p><p class="time">2020-06-07</p> <p class="message"><blockquote> </blockquote></p></li><li><p class="sender" style="color:#93ffcf">ZeterZero#2848</p><p class="time">2020-06-06</p> <p class="message">*Artoria walked into the room provided to her by the guild and didn&#x27;t waste time unpacking.

She held the lantern forward and where the light shined her belongings would suddenly appear, manifesting in a puff of smoke and cinder. Before long she had the small room filled, not perfectly orderly, but enough to feel comfortable. It was small, cramped, and had a single window and door. Perfect. She wasted no time removing her clothes except for her shirt and fell onto her bed, letting out a long, tired sigh.
